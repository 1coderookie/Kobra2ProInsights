href=#disassembling title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3> <p>Disassembling the printhead isn't really complicated. Just make sure you're careful and put the screws in a place and order that makes it easy for you to reassemble everything later. The following steps are just a rough guide through so that you know what you'll be confrontated with. I'd recommend to take a picture of each step, so that you can look at them later when reassembling - just in case you don't know how to proceed at a certain point or if you're not sure where certain screws belong. </p> <div class="admonition warning"> <p class=admonition-title>Warning</p> <ul> <li>If you need to disassemble the printhead for e.g. changing the hotend, <em>unload the filament first!</em> </li> <li>For changing the nozzle or disassembling the heatbreak from the heater block, you have to <em>heat up the parts first!</em> <br> The main reason for that is to melt the filament which most likely entered little gaps there. Usually it's said that it should be around 200°C but that's probably not sufficient because (in my opinion) it depends on the material of the filament. So my suggestion is to heat up the extruder about 5-10°C more than the temperature you're printing with, then you should be on the safe side. <br> So either do that using the pre-heat function of the printer or by using a sufficient heat gut. However - don't burn yourself by touching the hot metal parts!</li> <li>Before starting to tinker <em>turn off the printer</em> and <em>unplug it from the power outlet!</em></li> <li><em>Use the sufficient tools!</em> <br> So please don't try to loosen the nozzle with a pair of pliers for example, use e.g. a wrench for that. <br> I also strongly recommend to <em>not</em> use a pair of pliers for the heater block, also for that you should use a wrench (if you don't have one of that size, use an adjustable one). A wrench has a smooth surface and therefore won't scratch the surface or even put dents into the block. </li> <li>Make sure you <em>don't lose a screw</em> and make sure you'll <em>know where the screws belong</em> later when you want to reassemble everything again. <br> You might will be able to remember the belonging screws and positions if your tinkering lasts only an hour, but if anything crosses your plan and therefore you have to pause tinkering, you maybe won't remember one week later. So maybe start sorting the screws and take notes where they belong and/or take pictures right away from the start.</li> <li><em>Be patient and careful.</em> Generally speaking, if you unscrew something and it doesn't come off easy, don't start pulling too hard as you might have overseen a screw or clip, so better watch twice. </li> <li><em>Don't harm or rip off any wires</em> as it may cause severe damage to your mainboard or might be complicated to fix later on. </li> </ul> </div> <p>Whatever you want to do, like if you want to change the hotend, the heater block, the heatbreak, a fan or even want to disassemble the whole feeder system, you have to remove the plastic cover of the printhead first.<br> It's secured by two hexagon socket screws at the top of the metal back plate and a plastic clip at each side at the lower bottom as you can see at the following picture (well, you don't really see the plastic clip though but you can see the belonging notch of one of them). Be gentle and careful to not break one of the clips - the best way to get them out of their fittings is to gently push together the whole plastic cover at the bottom sides. </p> <p><img alt="Backside view of the head with mounted plastic cover" src=../../assets/images/head_K2Pro_backside_web.jpg> </p> <p>Inside of the plastic housing, you can see the part cooling fan with the fan duct.<br> <em>Mind the thin wire of the fan - you don't want to rip it off!</em> </p> <p><img alt="Fan parts" src=../../assets/images/head_K2Pro_cover-open_web.jpg> </p> <p>After the plastic cover is gone, you're looking at the plastic backplate of the feeder gear. Underneath it, you can see the the black heatsink with the hotend in the middle and the proximity sensor at the right side of the hotend. </p> <p><img alt="Front side view" src=../../assets/images/head_K2Pro_no-cover_web.jpg> </p> <!--  
Now we look at the left side where you can see the motor of the feeder gear. You can spot three hexagon socket screws there - two at the top and one at the bottom close to the motor housing, which are holding the entire feeder system onto the metal backplate.    

![Left side view](../assets/images/head_neo_leftside_motor_mount_marked_web.jpg)

From the right side view you see the fan for cooling the heatsink and the ABL sensor with the orange tip at the very right side of the construction.    

![Right side view](../assets/images/head_rightside_web.jpg) 
![Fan heatsink](../assets/images/head_neo_fan-heatsink_web.jpg)

Looking at the head from the bottom right side, you can see the fan outlet on the left, the hotend with the stock silicone sock and the orange tip of the ABL sensor.    

![Bottom right side view](../assets/images/head_bottom-view_web.jpg)   
The following picture shows the whole metal plate where the feeder construction (the marked tips of the three screws on the right side) and the bracket of the ABL sensor (the two marked screws on the left side) is mounted onto - I took these pictures when the head wasn't mounted to the carrier of the x-axis so you can have a better look at the deatails.

Don't try to force it too much - you do need a bit of force, but you have to make sure that everything is in place. </p> </details> <hr> <h2 id=acceleration-sensor>Acceleration Sensor<a class=headerlink href=#acceleration-sensor title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2> <p>There's an acceleration sensor located at the breakout board (component "U1"), the type of sensor is a LIS2DW12.<br> This one is being used for measuring the vibrances during the calibration process.</p> <hr> <h2 id=abl-sensor>ABL Sensor<a class=headerlink href=#abl-sensor title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2> <p>The printer comes with an inductive proximity sensor for automatic bed leveling (ABL) which detects the metal of the spring steel PEI plate.<br> The ABL sensor is the part with that round orange tip whic is located at the right hand side when looking at the printhead from the front. </p> <p>The following picture shows the location of the ABL sensor at the printhead, looking at it from a bottom view angle - the ABL sensor is the part at the right side with the round orange tip. </p> <p><img alt="Orange tip of the ABL sensor at the right side" src=../../assets/images/head_K2Pro_underside_web.jpg></p> <p>The ABL sensor itself is mounted in a plastic bracket which is then mounted to the metal backplate. </p> <p><img alt="ABL sensor" src=../../assets/images/head_K2Pro_abl-sensor_web.jpg></p> <p>The sensor is a PNP-NO type, 6-36V DC, with a three pin PH 2.0 connector. <br> The connections are: </p> <ul> <li>brown = VCC 24VDC</li> <li>blue = GND</li> <li>black = LEVEL/signal </li> </ul> <p>The position of the sensor (the height) should be adjusted in relation to the nozzle.<br> The procedure about how to adjust the position will be described for the specific printer model in the following section as well. </p> <hr> <h3 id=leveling-the-abl-sensor>Leveling The ABL Sensor<a class=headerlink href=#leveling-the-abl-sensor title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3> <p>The tip of the ABL sensor should be ~2mm higher than the tip of the nozzle.<br> If it's too high, the sensor won't be able to detect the spring steel PEI plate and your nozzle will be driven into the build plate. <br> So check if you need to level your ABL sensor in relation to the nozzle - this should be done after every maintenance at the hotend as well as when you got the printer brandnew from the manufacturer. </p> <div class="admonition warning"> <p class=admonition-title>Attention</p> <p>After adjusting the height of the ABL sensor, execute a new calibration procedure for having your new z-offset and bedmesh generated!<br> Keep an eye on your first layer and adjust the z-offset on the fly if necessary. </p> </div> <p>The following picture shows a sensor of a different printermodel that should/has to be leveled (don't mind the tiny rest of filament at the tip of the nozzle which touches the paper instead of the nozzle itself though, I chipped it away before leveling everything). </p> <p><img alt="This sensor needs to be leveld" src=../../assets/images/head_neo_ABL2level_web.jpg></p> <p>Therefore you can either use the ABL height gauge which sometimes comes with the printer or you can use the bigger one of the two-sided open ended wrench that comes in the toolset.<br> The following picture shows the height gauge that sometimes comes with the printer - if you don't have it and don't want to use the mentioned wrench, you can download <a href="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0245/5519/2380/files/Height_gauge.rar?v=1667814312">the gcode file</a> from Anycubic's support page and print it. </p> <p><img alt="ABL height gauge" src=../../assets/images/abl-gauge_web.jpg></p> <p>See the expandable textbox below for further instructions. </p> <details class=example> <summary>Leveling Procedure</summary> <ul> <li>Take the <a href="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0245/5519/2380/files/Height_gauge.rar?v=1667814312">height gauge</a> from Anycubic.<br> If you don't have the height gauge, take a sheet of paper and the bigger two-sided open-end wrench that came with your printer.<br> If you also don't have that, take something with a flat surface that is ~2mm thick.</li> <li>Put on the spring steel plate on the heated bed and place the printhead about the center of the bed.</li> <li>If you're using the height gauge, put it under the printhead and lower the head by turning the z axis rod manually.

It helps when you cut the filament in a 45° angle and bend the part you're manually feeding into the hotend so that it's pretty straight.<br> If you still can't get your filament loaded, it's most likely that the PTFE tube inside of the hotend is clogged or deformed or that you have a clog in or above the nozzle somewhere. To clean, inspect and maintain it, you need to disassemble the hotend. Check the section <a href=#disassembling-the-hotend>"Disassembling The Hotend"</a> further down below for more information. </p> </details> <details class=info> <summary>Retraction Settings</summary> <p>Make sure that you set the retraction distance and speed to the correct values for a direct drive in conjuction with a Volcano nozzle!<br> In general, it's supposed to be something around 1mm retraction <em>distance</em> for direct drive systems, when using a Volcano nozzle you should be fine going up to 2mm. A bit more might work well also, but you don't want to risk pulling the hot and melted filament up in the cold zone of the heatbreak, so don't exxagerate increasing the retraction distance.<br> Play around with the retraction <em>speed</em> as well, as the speed which is being used to actually retract the filament plays an important role as well.<br> You can find some more information about this topic in the section <a href=../../calibration/#retraction-settings>"Retraction Settings"</a>.</p> </details> <details class=tip> <summary>Feeder Gear Pressure</summary> <p>When adjusting the pressure of the feeder gear, make sure you don't tighten it up too much as it could squeeze and deform the filament. On the other hand it shouldn't be too loose though as it should transport the filament reliably.<br> The following picture shows you the location of the screw for adjusting the feeder gear tension.<br> <img alt="Feeder gear tensioner" src=../../assets/images/head_K2Pro_feeder-gear-tensioner_web.jpg> </p> <p>When pulling out the filament of the extruder system, you should notice little dents on the surface of the filament from the teeth of the feeder gear, the filament itself shouldn't be squeezed and deformed though, it should still be "round" so to say. You don't want the feeder gear to "bite" too much into the filament as well though, as this may lead to inconsistentites of the filament flow. I personally like to extrude a bit so that the gear actually has to pull it in. Then I do a cold pull and check the marks of the gear on the filament itself. If you can see and feel little marks of the teeth of the gear on the surface of the filament, then it should be ok. If you don't feel and see any marks, then it's too loose. PLA is pretty hard, so the pressure can/should be a bit higher as well, but if the marks are pretty deep, then it already might be too much. If the filament is already a bit squeezed and kinda flat, then it's definitely way too much pressure (you'll most likely experience some weird artefacts, inconcisties and patterns at your prints as well then). <br> The filament should be fed reliably, which especially comes into account while retracting. So keep an eye on the shaft of the motor by looking at the back of the motor - if you notice that it's slipping while retracting, you definitely need to increase the tension.<br> As a rule of thumb you can keep in mind that the pressure should be higher when using hard filament like PLA and lower when using soft filament like TPU. </p> </details> <hr> <h3 id=disassembling-the-feeder-gear>Disassembling The Feeder Gear<a class=headerlink href=#disassembling-the-feeder-gear title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3> <p>If problems with the feeder gear occur, you have to open the feeder gear box or even disassemble the whole system for cleaning, further inspections or replacing certain parts.<br> Especially when printing soft material like TPU, it can happen that filament gets wind up and jammed in the feeder gear which you then can't pull out.<br> Besides that, residues or abrasion can build up in the feeder gear system, so it's good to check this and do a proper cleaning when facing extrusion issues. </p> <p>Please see the expandable textbox below for further instructions about how to open the feeder gear box to get access to the interior parts. </p> <details class=example> <summary>Disassembling Procedure</summary> <ul> <li>When you take off the blue plastic cover of the printhead (Attention: disconnect the part cooling fan cable when taking off the head's cover!), you can see the extruder gearbox above the black metal heatsink.

Just take the existing ones out of the old heater block and install them into the new one. </li> <li>However, scroll down and check out the "Disassembling" section below to see how to dis- and reassemble it. <em>Maybe you don't need new parts, so try to clean up everything first and reassemble it before ordering new parts right away.</em> </li> </ul> </details> <details class=tip> <summary>Can't Load New Filament?!</summary> <p>For loading new filament, you need to have the hotend heated up to the belonging temperature first - you can't load filament in a cold hotend, as it won't melt in there. </p> <p>If you can't load new filament, first of all check if you pushed the lever on the feeder gear to the right hand side. If you did so and were able to insert the filament but it seems that it's getting stuck lower down in the hotend, then you might hit the end of the nozzle with an edge of your filament. It helps when you cut the filament in a 45° angle and bend the part you're manually feeding into the hotend so that it's pretty straight.<br> If you still can't get your filament loaded, it's most likely that the PTFE tube inside of the hotend is clogged or deformed or that you have a clog in or above the nozzle somewhere.

The reason for that is that the heatbreak and the end of the nozzle don't touch tight enough, so that the melted filament can squeeze out. It also may be caused by bad and cheap parts where the threads aren't just as good as they should be. <br> <img alt=Blob src=../../assets/images/head_K2_blob_web.jpg> <br> So if you encouter this problem, here is what I recommend to do (based on my own experience with this dilemma). </p> <ul> <li>Take off the plastic cover first to get better access to the whole area. </li> <li>Heat up everthing.</li> <li>Once the filament starts to melt and became soft, I'd suppose to turn off the printer, just to make you don't cause any shortcuts in case you harm the wires. </li> <li>Then grab a wooden stick and take away as much as possible carefully. <em>Don't</em> use a screwdriver or something like that to do so as you might harm the wires and/or cause a shortcut at e.g. the contacts of the cartridge heater.<br> <em>Be really careful when taking away the clumps to not harm or rip off any of the wires!</em> You can also use a cloth to wipe off the melted filament from the heater block and so on, just make sure you don't burn yourself! </li> <li>For the next steps you need to be a bit quick in proceeding them, so if this is the first time you're diassembling the hotend, take a look at the sections here at the page and read them first so you'll know where the screws are located and which steps you need to take. Then proceed with the following steps.</li> <li>So, once everything is as clean as possible, heat everything up again. The turn off the printer and loosen the two grub screws inside the heater block to take out the thermistor and the cartridge heater. Give it a quick wipe with the cloth if they're covered by a lot of filament, too (but don't waste too much time here as the filament is becoming hard again now pretty quick!). </li> <li>Then disassemble the hotend (see description below), so take out the nozzle from the heater block and unscrew the heater block from the heatbreal. Pay attention if you can feel that the heatbreak was loose in the heater block to check if that was the reason for the filament being able to squeeze out and build up. </li> <li>If you were using a cheap nozzle and have a spare one, just throw away the old one. If it's a good or your only nozzle, try to get it back to work again by giving it a proper cleaning and doing some cold pulls when it's installed again. </li> <li>Now put all the metal parts (heatbreak, heater block and probably the nozzle) in a glass with acetone. close the lid and let it sit there for about 24hrs. The acetone won't dissolve PLA filament or so automagically like it does with ABS, but it'll make it soft and easier to clean. </li> <li>In the meantime you can take care of the thermistor and the cartridge heater. Scratch off the hardened filament from the metal parts by using a cutter for example, but be <em>really</em> careful to not slip off and harm any wires! I personally didn't take care of the little clump at the part where ther wires are coming out of the metal part because I didn't wanted to risk harming the wires, so I just let it sit there. </li> <li>When you're about to clean the meatal parts which soaked in the acetone, I'd recommend wearing disposable gloves as acteone isn't really healthy for your skin. So put on those gloves and start cleaning the parts by carefully scratching off the rest of the filament. Use a cutter, a brass brush etc., but always be careful to not really harm anything. Pay special attention to all the threads and the holes of the heater block where the thermistor and the cartridge heater will take place. If you don't get everything cleaned up at the first time, just put it back in the acetone, wait again and then repeat the cleaning steps. </li> <li>Once everything looks nice and clean, rinse off the acetone with clear water and let it dry. This is especially important for the inner side of the nozzle - you don't want to have acetone in there. </li> <li>Then reassemble the hotend (see description below) and put it back in place. Read the notes in the specific sections here about how to reassemble the specific parts and what to pay attention to. </li> <li>At the end when everything is reassembled and you heated up the hotend to finally mount the nozzle and load the filament, extrude filament to see if everything is ok. </li> <li>If so (I hope it will be!), don't start printing right away - execute a PID tuning for the hotend first. </li> <li>Also check if you need to re-level the ABL sensor in relation to the nozzle due to a probably different position of the hotend now. </li> <li>Execute an ABL and take care of your Z-offset, most likely the position of your nozzle will be different due to a different position of the whole hotend. </li> </ul> </details> <hr> <h4 id=disassembling-the-hotend>Disassembling The Hotend<a class=headerlink href=#disassembling-the-hotend title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4> <p>If you need to dismount the hotend from the printhead to change it or if you need to disassemble it, check out the expandable textbox below for further instructions. </p> <div class="admonition warning"> <p class=admonition-title>Warning</p> <ul> <li>When pulling out the hotend, <em>make sure the PTFE tube placed in the heatbreak comes out, too!</em> </li> <li>Inspect the PTFE tube if it's burned, deformed or clogged - if so, get a new one as a replacement (I'd recommend using a Capricorn XS bowden tube).

#### MOD: Different Hotend 
Besides the stock hotend you can also just get or build yourself your own hotend by using a V5 compatible heatbreak and heater block which fits just fine. When doing so, pay attention to the dimensions though, as e.g. a lower position of the nozzle due to a longer heatbreak requires adaptation of the position of the part cooling fan duct!  

Genereally speaking, it's also possible to upgrade to a completely different system, like a V6, a Volcano or a MK8 - if you're willing and capable of tinkering. In that case I assume you already know what you should pay attention to, so I won't go deeper into this.  

The following pictures show two hotends I built myself from third party manufacturer parts. In both cases I used an original E3D V6 nozzle, a plated copper V5 heater block and a Capricorn XS PTFE tube for 1.75mm filament. Then I used a heatbreak for V5 compatible heater blocks where the PTFE tube goes all the way down to the nozzle (like the stock one) for printing PLA, and a bi-metal heatbreak where the PTFE tube only sticks into the top of the heatbreak for ~4mm for printing PETG and other material that needs higher temperatures.

![Bi-metal 3rd party hotend](../assets/images/head_neo_bimetal-hotend_complete_web.jpg)

The following pictures show each hotend being disassembled. You can clearly see the shorter PTFE tube of the hotend with the bi-metal heatbreak.

!!! warning "Adjust The Position Of The Part Cooling Fan"  

    If you're going to use a heatbreak which is longer than the stock one, pay attention to the part cooling fan duct / fan duct outlet. As the whole hotend setup will be slightly longer and the nozzle will be positioned a bit lower, you need to adjust the position of the fan duct (outlet), so that it doesn't point the airstream onto the nozzle, but onto the printed part.  
    As the fan duct models being available at Thingiverse, Printables etc are made for the stock setup, you'll have to modify the design, so that the outlet will come lower.  
    I did this for two models, but as I want to finetune that a bit and don't have an account there yet, I didn't put those modified version online yet. Once I did that, I'll link to them, so that you can just print them without the need of extra modification.  

!!! warning "Lower Your Retraction Distance When Using A Bi-Metal/All-Metal Heatbreak"

    When using a bi-metal/all-metal heatbreak, keep an eye on your retraction distance setting. Generally speaking, you should decrease/lower that value.

This especially might come into place and cause issues when printing softer material like TPU. <br> <em>I might be completely wrong with my assumptions though, so don't take my thoughts on this as being correct!</em> Either just use the reverse bowden when changing the position of your spool or do some research about this topic on your own. I didn't really dive into this topic any further yet, but I most likely will do so anywhere in the future. </p> <p>Reverse bowden tubes do have some advantages though, as they constrain the distance between their mounting point at the frame and the extruder. When the extruder is pushing back filament, the risk of tangling filament which then might be caught by the moving printhead therefore is reduced. </p> <p>However, I personally would recommend to change the stock reverse bowden tube to a better Capricorn XS tube, as they have a lower overall friction due to their special coating/recipe. </p> <p>If you're interested in this topic, maybe read this article written by Thomas Sanladerer (and/or watch his video about it): <a href=https://toms3d.org/2022/09/06/should-you-use-a-reverse-bowden/ >Should you use a Reverse Bowden</a>. </p> </details> <hr> <h3 id=ptfe-inliner>PTFE Inliner<a class=headerlink href=#ptfe-inliner title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3> <p>The short PTFE tube which is located in the hotend/heatbreak is about 41mm long.<br> Here the PTFE tube only is an inliner for the heatbreak. </p> <p>The following picture shows the PTFE inliner assembled in the hotend's heatbreak. </p> <p><img alt="PTFE inliner assembled" src=../../assets/images/head_K2Pro_hotend_PTFE-inliner-assembled_web.jpg> </p> <p>The following picture shows one of the spare PTFE inliner tubes which come with the machine. </p> <p><img alt="Spare PTFE inliner" src=../../assets/images/head_K2Pro_spare-PTFE-inlet_web.jpg> </p> <div class="admonition warning"> <p class=admonition-title>Check The PTFE Inliner</p> <p>If you start to have issues whith filament being fed or extruded incorrectly, take out the assembled hotend from the heatsink to access the PTFE inliner.<br> You can simply pull this little tube out, you shouldn't have to use much force to do so - if you can't get the tube out easily, then it's already a clear sign that there's an issue.<br> If you can't get it out <em>at all</em>, then you need to heat up the hotend to the degree that you can pull it out.

### MOD: Different Heater Block

!!! warning "Execute A PID Tuning"

    Whenever you change something at your hotend setup, remember to execute a PID tuning.  


You can pick any V5 type of heater block you want if you have to exchange or want to mod/upgrade your existing hotend.  
However, it might be smart to not get the cheapest one available as they sometimes lack of precision and therefore may cause problems with leaking filament.  

Usually the heater blocks are made of aluminum, but you can also get them made of plated copper (which I personally use and highly recommend) as shown in the following picture.  

![V5 plated copper](../assets/images/head_heaterblock-v5-copper_web.jpg)


There are also ceramic heater blocks on the market which come with M6 threads - those ones can be used as well. The following picture shows one of these already being mounted.  

![Ceramic block](../assets/images/head_neo_ceramic-heaterblock_web.jpeg)

However, as they come with an inbuilt heating element and an inbuilt thermistor, make sure to get yourself the correct type regarding the specs.  
Also pay attention to the length of the wires of these units and the connectors they're coming with - it might be necessary to do a bit of a tinkering to get these ones installed.  
Last but not least check the height of these units and compare it to the V5 heater block setup - most likely it will be necessary to adjust the position of your fan duct and the settings as well.

If your multimeter doesn't have this function, you can measure the resistance instead.<br> However, <em>it's advisable to measure the resistance, even though your multimeter offers the function of probing for continuity,</em> because it might be the case that a wire still passes the check for continuity, but that individual strands of the wire are broken. This causes problems if those strands lose contact permanently or during movement of the head, as it leads to a higher resistance and therefore a wrong temperature being reported. </p> <p>The difficulty here though is to actually measure one wire by itself, because you can only access one end of the wire (at the connector), the other end is inside of the thermistor's capsule. So if you measure the resistance probing at both contacts of the two wires, you already measure the thermistor itself as well. <br> However, by doing so you could still be able to tell if the wiring is faulty when you move the wires around while probing and see if the resistance value will spontaneously change. It actually wouldn't really help you in the end though to know if it's either the wiring or the thermistor itself, as you can't just change the wiring.

??? info "Ceramic Heater Block With Inbuilt Heating Element"

    There are ceramic heater blocks on the market which come with M6 threads and an inbuilt heating element (24V, 55W) and a thermistor (100k, most likely it's a "Generous 3950" type). The wires usually aren't long enough for these printers and lack the belonging plugs as well, so further tinkering is necessary to get these ones installed.

    After successful installation of the new thermistor and/or cartridge heater, execute a [PID tuning](calibration.md#pid-tuning) using e.g. Octoprint!

You'll risk a shortcut which then will harm your motherboard and might even cause more severe damage! </p> <p>Generally speaking, you can check the wiring of the 24V line by measuring the electrical continuity of the wires. If your multimeter doesn't have this function, you can measure the resistance instead. <br> However, <em>it's advisable to measure the resistance, even though your multimeter offers the function of probing for continuity,</em> because it might be the case that a wire still passes the check for continuity, but that individual strands of the wire are broken. This causes problems if those strands lose contact permanently or during movement of the head, as it leads to a higher resistance.<br> At the 24V wires this can lead to the circumstance that the wire will get hot at that spot, that the insulation will melt, that a shortcut might occur and it might even occur that it causes a fire. </p> <p>The difficulty here though is to actually measure one wire by itself, because you can only access one end of the wire (at the connector), the other end is inside of the hetaer cartridge's capsule. So if you measure the resistance probing at both contacts of the two wires, you already measure the cartridge heater itself as well.<br> However, by doing so you could still be able to tell if the wiring is faulty when you move the wires around while probing and see if the resistance value will spontaneously change. It actually wouldn't really help you in the end though to know if it's either the wiring or the cartridge heater itself, as you can't just change the wiring. Due to the construction of the cartridge heater and it's wiring, you'd have to replace the whole unit anyway though. </p> </details> <details class=example> <summary>Checking The 24V Heating Circuit Of The Cartridge Heater</summary> <p>You can check the 24V heating circuit of the cartridge heater itself.

Those often lack quality: the bore might be off-center and/or might have a burr (which leads to heavy stringing), the thread might not be precise (which leads to leaking) and so on.<br> I personally only use <a href=https://e3d-online.com/products/volcano-nozzles><strong>original E3D Volcano nozzles</strong></a>. Yes, they are a bit more expensive than the super cheap ones, but it's still a good price and it's really worth it - they last longer, they're precisely made and you'll get much better results. As long as you don't want to print special abrasive filaments, you're always good with the standard E3D V6 brass nozzles. </p> </li> <li> <p>If you want to print filaments that are more abrasive, you probably want to go with nozzles made from plated copper, stainless or hardened steel, ruby sapphire nozzles and so on. Check out the web for further and more specific information about what to choose.<br> Be aware of the fact though, that the manufacturers <em>clearly advise against doing cold pulls with any kind of coated nozzles</em>! This also involves hardened steel nozzles! Referring to them, the coating might be harmed when doing so. </p> </li> </ul> </details> <details class=info> <summary>About Nozzle Sizes</summary> <p>When it comes down to choose the right nozzle size, it all depends on what you want to print and how detailed it should be. The standard size of 0.4mm the printers come with is a good starting point.<br> However, you may find yourself in the situation that you want to print more detailed objects or objects which should be more sturdy or where it doesn't matter if the surface doesn't look as clean and flat as possible, so you probably should adjust the size and switch to a smaller oder bigger diameter like 0.2mm for high detailed objects and 0.6mm for the 'rougher' prints. <br> Keep in mind though that the printing time usually increases by choosing a smaller diameter and it decreases when you're using a bigger diameter.<br> The printing time as well as the quality also depends on the <a href=../../calibration/#layer-height>layer height</a> you're using, so by choosing a smaller layer height you can also get detailed and great looking prints with a 0.6mm nozzle.<br> Last but not least a smaller nozzle bore is more likely to clog and some filaments even have a sticker on the spool saying that e.g. it should be printed with minimum a 0.4mm nozzle. So choose wisely if you really want to use a nozzle with a 0.2mm bore for example. </p> <p>Search the web for more specific information about finding and choosing the right nozzle size for your project. You may want to start with this article from <a href=https://www.all3dp.com/2/3d-printer-nozzle-size-material-what-to-know-which-to-buy>All3DP: The Best 3D Printer Nozzle Types, Sizes &amp; Materials</a>. </p> <p>In the following I'll mention some aspects you should be aware of when choosing a different nozzle size, particularly when choosing a bigger nozzle. Most people seem to be stuck to the common 0.4 nozzle and don't seem to be aware of the fact that one can still get 'fine' detailed outcomes (more or less - of course there's a difference in the ability of printing super fine details when e.g. comparing a 0.2 to a 0.6 nozzle..) or 'even' surfaces with a bigger nozzle size as well if e.g. going with the same layer height.<br> The increased line width helps cutting down the printing time and makes prints even more rigid. </p> <p>For testing around just copy your existent profile and change the nozzle size in there. Save it as an own profile and start playing around. </p> <ul> <li>Printing temperature: when using a bigger nozzle, one needs to keep an eye on the printing temperature. The bigger the nozzle is, the more filament will flow thru the bore at the same time - and therefore less time it has to completely melt so to say. So instead of using the same temp like with the 0.4 nozzle, increase the temperature. How much that has to be depends on the diameter of the nozzle, the type of filament etc - so maybe start with increasing 5°C or 10°C and see how it turns out. </li> <li>Printing speed: the same as for the printing temp. Generally speaking, the faster you want to print, the hotter you have to print as well to compensate/reach the higher flowrate and have the same amount melted in the same time. I often see ppl going with e.g. 190-200° for PLA and trying to print at the max speeds the new K2 models can reach - that most likely doesn't work. Instead, increase the temp and/or decrease the speed. </li> </ul> <p>For both of these points there are somewhat limitations tho, so when e.g. printing small and thin parts you'll most likely run into issues when printing too fast as well as when printing too hot, as the material might not have enough time to cool down properly and therefore curls up or behaves weird in other ways. One can try to compensate that (besides choosing the suitable speed&amp;temp) by making use of the minimum layer time settings in the slicer. </p> <ul> <li>Retraction settings: you need to keep an eye on and dial in your retraction settings when using a bigger nozzle size. Try different retraction <em>speed</em> settings as well, not only retraction <em>distance</em>. </li> <li>Use the Arachne feature in your Slicer - Prusa has it and iirc also Cura has it.<br> That being said, when using a bigger nozzle, you might want to check if it makes sense to add one or two more walls. As most of the models are somewhat designed for being printed with the common 0.4 nozzle, I found that this comes into account when choosing the amount of walls and the percentage of the infill as well. So adding e.g. one more wall can often save you from printing any infill and you'll end up with a cleaner and even more rigid print. </li> <li>You can also take advantage of the feature "adaptive layer height". However, when doing so, keep an eye on the settings as you might reach the maximum flowrate (= limit) or even try to go beyond it. There are online calculators you can use where you type in the layer height, line width and printing speed and then you'll have the according flowrate calculated. </li> <li>There's a 'physical' limitation to what's possible in terms of maximum flowrate and even the thermal conductivity of the filament itself. So don't expect to successfully use a 1mm nozzle at 300mm/s printing speed printing huge models with super long layer lines from regular PLA - that most likely won't work out. There are a few things one could do when trying to really reach or even go beyond the limits, like using a Volcano CHT nozzle, using specific HighSpeed-filament and so on. </li> <li>I personally use plated copper heater blocks at my printers, even tho I'm not going for the highest possible speed. Imho it made a difference due to the increased thermal mass of the heavy copper block vs the aluminum block. </li> <li>Depending on what speeds should be reached and how big the nozzle will be in the end, it <em>might</em> be good/useful to also use a more powerful heater cartridge when already changing the heater block to a plated copper one. This shouldn't be necessary for the typical user tho as the stock one is 60W and that's usually plenty enough, but just in case one really wants to push the limits, it might be good to have an extra 10W or so and use a 70W heater instead. </li> </ul> </details> <hr> <h3 id=spare-nozzles>Spare Nozzles<a class=headerlink href=#spare-nozzles title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3> <p>If you need to replace the nozzle, you either have to buy spare part nozzles directly from Anycubic or find a 3<sup>rd</sup> party seller who sells these specific nozzles.

Referring to the manufacturers, the coating might be harmed when doing so. </p> </div> <details class=example> <summary>Cleaning The Nozzle</summary> <ul> <li>For cleaning the nozzle and getting rid of excessive filament during the printing process or right before printing starts as the extruder is heating up, you can use a long and thin wooden stick like a skewer. A wooden toothpick also works fine - just make sure you don't burn yourself as it may be a bit short. I personally use these long pipe cleaners which have this kinda cotton stuff all around them. It doesn't melt when touching the hot nozzle and filament sticks great to it. </li> <li>Before and after each print I recommend to wipe away the melted filament at the nozzle with a 'cotton' pipe cleaner, a paper towel or a cloth - but <em>don't burn yourself!</em> This procedure keeps the nozzle clean and the rest of the filament won't burn black onto the brass which makes it hard to remove later. </li> <li>If the nozzle is already too smeared and has too much filament burnt onto the surface to be cleaned with a paper towel, you can use a small brass brush. Be careful though to not harm the tip of the nozzle by scrubbing too hard across it! Be careful to <em>not</em> touch any wires or contacts during brushing at it may cause a shortcut and blow off your mainboard! So I'd suggest you heat up the nozzle and then turn off the printer before starting to brush. </li> <li>If the nozzle is clogged, using a needle with the correct diameter to stick it into the hot nozzle for cleaning it sometimes works. Just stick in in the heatened up nozzle and poke around. Be careful to not harm the tip of the nozzle though! </li> <li>You can also use certain filament which is made for cleaning. You load it and let it run through. </li> <li>If the nozzle is clogged and therefore the cleaning filament can't run through, you could also try to do a <em>"cold pull"</em>. To do so you heat up the nozzle to about 220°C, load the cleaning filament and manually push it through a bit. Then let the nozzle cool down to about 90-100°C and rip out the filament. You may have to repeat this procedure a few times until the cleaning filament can run through again. However, be careful not to rip off the filament by doing the cold pull as you then definitely have to disassemble the hotend.<br> <em>Attention: don't do cold pulls when using any kind of coated nozzles! This also involves hardened steel nozzles! The manufacturers say that it might harm the coating of the inside of the nozzle!</em> </li> <li>If you still encounter problems with the flow of the filament though or if you even can't load new filament, most likely the little PTFE tube inside of the heatbreak is clogged. Scroll down to the "Disassembling" section where you'll find a little guide about how to get it out and clean it. </li> <li>If you took out the nozzle from the heater block and can't get it clean, heat it up with a hot air gun. Then you can poke out the soft filament. You can also try to put it in acetone and let it sit there - the longer the better (I'd say minimum 24hrs). This method works especially great with ABS as that just dissolves, but it also works at least a bit with other types of filament like PLA (although not as good as with ABS at all) and makes it a bit softer. Then you can try to poke the filament out. This also works with the heater block and the heatbreak if you want to clean them also. Make sure to rinse them with water before installing though. </li> </ul> </details> <hr> <h3 id=changing-the-nozzle>Changing The Nozzle<a class=headerlink href=#changing-the-nozzle title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3> <p>If you need to change the nozzle, mind the warnings from above and check out the following steps in the expandable block below.</p> <div class="admonition warning"> <p class=admonition-title>Heat Up The Hotend First!</p> <ul> <li><strong><em>Never try to unscrew the nozzle from the heater block while the parts are cold!</em></strong><br> Melted filament or some kind of screw lock glue will make it hard or even impossible to unscrew it and you risk to shear off the nozzle! So always heat up the hotend to ~240°C before attempting to unscrew the nozzle from the block! </li> <li>Make sure you're holding the heater block tight and in place to avoid <em>any</em> movement and don't overtighten the nozzle when installing it! </li> </ul> </div> <details class=example> <summary>Changing The Nozzle</summary> <ul> <li>If you just want to change the nozzle, take off the silicone sock of the heater block, then <em>heat up the extruder first</em> about 5-10°C above your regular printing temperature and pull back the filament a bit once it's warm enough. </li> <li>Once the extruder heated up, let it sit at that temperature for about a minute or two to make sure that even the last amount of filament which might stick somewhere in the gaps or the thread is melted. </li> <li>Then <em>turn off the printer</em> and ideally unplug it from the power outlet. Don't fiddle around while it's turned on - in case you slip with the wrench and harm the wires you could create a shortcut which most likely will blow something up of your mainboard. </li> <li>Then grab the heater block with a wrench to hold it in place and screw out the nozzle carefully. Use a sufficient tool like a wrench or a socket wrench for the nozzle - don't use a pair of pliers as it may/will round off the screw nut. </li> <li>Make sure you don't turn the heater block at all to not loosen it from the heat break! Just hold it in place.</li> <li>If the nozzle won't come loose, heat up the extruder again, raise the temperature a bit and let it sit longer to melt the filament in the gaps which seems to block. Before trying to unscrew the nozzle, switch off the printer again. <br> If that still doesn't work, you could take a piece of damp cloth and hold it against the nozzle (<em>not</em> the heater block, <em>only the nozzle</em>!) for a moment to cool it down. Due to the sudden decrease of temperature the metal of the nozzle will contract a tiny bit which may result in being able to unscrew it. </li> <li>For installing the new nozzle, screw it in and turn it back about one rotation once you feel it hits the heatbreak. I personally do this after everything cooled down until it's safe to touch because then I can screw in the nozzle by hand and therefore I can feel right at the start if it doesn't sit correctly.</li> <li>Check if you didn't harm any wires! </li> <li>If everything is fine, power up the printer and heat up the extruder again. Most nozzle manufacturers say that you should heat it up to about 250°C, but that might already harm the PTFE tube. So go with 230-240°. </li> <li>Then carefully tighten up the nozzle, but don't overtighten it though. However, you need to make sure that it's tight enough (about 1.5NM) and that it really touches the heatbreak! There shouldn't be any gap between the heatbreak and the nozzle inside of the heater block! </li> <li>Don't get irritated by the fact that there's a little gap between the head of the nozzle and the heater block oncce you installed everything correctly - that's totally fine and it's supposed to be like that as the following picture shows. <br> <img alt="Mounted nozzle" src=../assets/images/head_nozzle-mounted_web.jpg> </li> </ul> </details> <hr> <h2 id=part-cooling-fan>Part Cooling Fan<a class=headerlink href=#part-cooling-fan title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2> <p>The part cooling fan is a 24V, 0.14A, 50x50x20mm blower, model "Coolcox BF5020H24D". </p> <p>According to the <a href=https://www.coolcox.com/products/pdf/BF5020_a.pdf>specifications of the manufacturer</a>, the bearing type of this fan is a 2-ball bearing. The current is listed as 0.08A, even though the label at the fan itself states 0.14A. The fanspeed is listed with 5000rpm, Anycubic states at the product page 7000rpm though. The air flow is listed with 6.0 CFM and the noise level is listed with 34.0 dBA. </p> <p><img alt="Coolcox BF5020H24D front" src=../../assets/images/head_K2Pro_part-cooling-fan_web.jpg> </p> <hr> <h3 id=fan-duct>Fan Duct<a class=headerlink href=#fan-duct title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3> <p>The fan duct for the 5020 part cooling blower fan has two outlets at the sides as the following picture shows. </p> <p><img alt="Part cooling fan duct" src=../../assets/images/head_K2Pro_part-cooling-fanduct_mounted_backside_web.jpg> </p> <p>Mind the additional opening at the left handed side in the picture - it seems to be there for cooling the ABL sensor.
