I'd assume that they look pretty much the same in the inside though, so at least you'll get an idea of how a belt tensioner is (most likely) built.</strong> </p> <p>It might happen that you have to disassemble the tensioner in order to replace a broken belt or a broken (part of the) tensioner.<br> In that case turn the knob counter-clockwise until the belt completely sags. Then unhook one end of the belt from the bedgantry (I suggest to unhook it in the front of the bed gantry). Unscrew the two screws you can see at the blue plastic cap of the belt tensioner and carefully pull it off the frame. You might have to turn the knob even more counter-clockwise if it doesn't come off right away.<br> Once you've pulled it off, you'll see the parts as shown in the picture below (right now the picture shows the disassembled y-axis tensioner, but besides a slightly different shaped plastic cap, the interior looks the same - I'll add a belonging picture of the x-axis tensioner soo though). </p> <p><img alt="Belt tensioner unmounted" src=../../assets/images/axes_y-tensioner_dis1_web.jpg></p> <p>If you have to replace certain parts, you can easily disassemble the pulley by pushing out that little shaft to one side, so that you'll have all the parts laying in front of you each by their own. </p> <p><img alt="Belt tensioner disassembled" src=../../assets/images/axes_y-tensioner_dis2_web.jpg> </p> <p>The following picture shows the 20 teeth pulley which is used in this assembly. </p> <p><img alt="20 teeth pulley" src=../../assets/images/axes_20teeth-pulley_web.jpg> </p> </details> <details class=example> <summary>Reassembling The Belt Tensioner</summary> <p>For reassembling, just put the pulley back into place and stick that little shaft back to where it belongs.<br> Then route the belt through that bracket - make sure the belt isn't somehow twisted and that the teeth are gripping onto the pulley - the smooth side of the belt needs to face you when you look at it from above.<br> Stick the setup back into the blue plastic cap and stick the screw of that knob into the belonging hole at the front. Turn the knob a few times clockwise to make the thread grip the bracket.<br> Then slide the whole setup back into place where it belongs and screw in the two screws which hold the blue plastic cap into place.<br> finally hook up the ends of the belt to those notches at the metal mounting plate of the printhead again. <br> Once everything is done, adjust the belt tension again by turning the knob clockwise. </p> </details> <hr> <h4 id=belt-tension>Belt Tension<a class=headerlink href=#belt-tension title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4> <p>It's kinda difficult to explain the correct belt tension, so you'd have to experiment a bit with that.<br> Generally speaking, the belt shouldn't be too tightened up and shouldn't be too loose either. If it's too tight, too much pressure will be put onto the motor shaft which will do harm, the belt can snap etc. - if it's too loose though, the belt might even slip. Either state (too tensioned and too loose) can cause artifacts. </p> <p>My 'rule of thumb' here is: if you can bend the belt down a bit by applying some pressure with your finger onto it but you still feel a good amount of resistance, then it's a good sign that you're in the right area of tension. So start from there and if you feel or need to do so, play around with different belt tensions while printing the same bject over and over again for finding the best tension for your setup. </p> <details class=info> <summary>Some Notes On Belt Tension</summary> <p>People often recommend "Tighten your belts!", but that's actually not always the solution if artifacts like layer shifts occur.<br> As a matter of fact, I made many different tests with my Neos and evaluated the different influences of factors like belt tension, wheel position, quality of ball bearings of the wheels, a trammed vs. untrammed frame/printer setup and so on. And to be honest: a belt being too loose in terms of being the cause for severe problems only occured when it was really <em>that</em> loose that even someone who has no experience at all with this would notice it. If a belt is sagging, I'd assume that a user would notice that and realizes that this can't be good. </p> <p>Don't get me wrong - <em>of course</em> different tensions of the belts <em>do</em> have a certain influence of the quality of the print, and it might be worth to finetune the tension for getting the last little amount of perfection out of your print.<br> And yes, of course, if a belt is too loose, then it can slip or it can cause layer shifts due to a slight 'lag' which occurs when the motors start to drive the belt or when a sudden change of the direction occurs.<br> But: a belt being too tight can cause artifacts as well. Not only that - it can and actually will harm the hardware. Users reported not only snapped belts or harmed motors, one even reported a bent bracket where the motor of the Y-axis was mount to. So, believe me or not: even though there are people in forums and on YouTube who claim that a belt can't be too tight - it definitely can. </p> <p>Using the abovementioned 'method' of roughly setting your belt tension to a 'medium' value, I found that other factors have a much bigger impact on the print quality and the reliability and well-functioning of the whole printer.<br> Let me give you two short examples to show you what I mean: </p> <ul> <li>If your wheels are too tight, of course you also need to increase the belt tension - but in that case it's not the belt tension what's causing the issue in the first place, it's the wrong position of the wheels. </li> <li>If you have bad ball bearings at the wheels (which is actually most likely the case due to the cheap parts being used), then those may cause an irregular/inconsistent movement of the wheels and you can feel regular 'hiccups' while moving the belonging part (like the bedgantry or the printhead). You can <em>feel</em> how you have to apply more force at certain spots when moving the part manually by hand, as it feels like it's getting stuck at certain spots. So a belt being too loose isn't the cause of the problem here and therefore tightening up your belt isn't the solution - replacing the bad bearings with some quality ones is. </li> </ul> <p>So, use your brain and don't always follow the typical answers like "Tighten you belts!" when you're experiencing issues like layer shifts for example. Instead, look at your printer more 'holistic' and see the different parts which are working together in the end. Pay attention to each of them, once again starting by inspecting the frame and making sure everything is still trammed and set up well here. Due to vibrations and repetitive motions screws can come loose, parts can and will wear out and therefore a frame or other parts you set up a while ago can and will come out of alignment by time.</p> </details> <hr> <h4 id=maintenance>Maintenance<a class=headerlink href=#maintenance title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4> <p>You should inspect the belts and the belonging parts like pulleys etc from time to time to make sure everything is in a good condition and nothing will suddenly break. </p> <p><strong>Belt</strong></p> <ul> <li>Check the belt tension from time to time as it might wear out and lengthen a bit. </li> <li>Check the teeth of the belt if they are still good looking or if they're worn out or if even some teethe are missing.</li> <li>Check if you can see any cracks or other damage at the belt.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Pulleys</strong> </p> <ul> <li>Check the pulleys of the motors which are driving the belts. Are they also looking ok? Did they become loose on the motor shaft somehow? </li> </ul> <details class=example> <summary>Broken/Snapped Belt</summary> <p>When you experience a broken/snapped/ripped belt, it's most likely caused by too much belt tension. Of course the belt itself can be physically harmed as well when grinding across sharp edges or when it gets old, but you should notice that when examining the belt every now and then when doing the regular maintenace of your printer. </p> <p>If you encounter a snapped belt, get yourself a good quality one as a replacement - don't go with the cheapest no-name product you can get.<br> I'd suggest to look out for an original "Gates Powergrip®" belt. You can get them in different lengths, like one or five meters.<br> Then get yourself some of those metal clamps you have to crimp at the ends of the belts as well. If you feel insecure about how to properly add those clamps to the belt and how to actually crimp them properly, practice crimping a few to your old broken belt. </p> <p>Crimp one of those clamps to one end of the belt, measure the belonging length of the belt and apply the other one, then cut off the rest of it.<br> Install the belt by disassembling the belonging parts like the belt tensioners (see the notes on how to do so in the belonging sections).<br> Pay attention to route the belt in the correct way and not being twisted and adjust the tension of the belt once everything is reassembled. </p> </details> <hr> <h3 id=x-axis-motor>X-Axis Motor<a class=headerlink href=#x-axis-motor title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3> <p>The motor of the x-axis is a 42-34 Nema 17 stepper motor with a 16 teeth pulley being attached to the 5mm motor shaft.<br> It seems to be a regular 1.8° stepper, which means the shaft turns 1.8° at each steps, and therefore it's doing 200 steps for one full 360° rotation.<br> The motor is located at the left hand side of the x-axis gantry. </p> <p><img alt="X motor" src=../../assets/images/axes_K2Pro_X-motor_web.jpg> </p> <details class=info> <summary>Spare Part Motor</summary> <p>As there aren't any specifications and replacement motors from Anycubic being available, you can either use a motor with the beforementioned specs or get yourself a motor from a Creality Ender 3 (or one that's advertised to fit that printer). </p> </details> <details class=warning> <summary>Attention When Connecting A 'Generic' Motor!</summary> <p>As the connections of the stock vs a generic or a 'Creality'-type motor are/might be different due to different pinouts of the coils, you need to make sure you connect it correctly!<br> <em>So, before connecting it to the mainboard though, take your multimeter and identify the coils by probing the pins of the motor's connector!</em><br> Compare your findings with the ones from the stock motor - you might have to switch the position of certain wires inside of the plug.</p> </details> <details class=example> <summary>Identifying The Coils And Connections</summary> <p>When you want to use a different motor than the stock ones, it's most likely the case that the coils are connected to different pins of the 6 pin connector of the motor.<br> The best would be if you take a multimeter and probe the pins to see which ones belong to a coil. So let me go over this procedure really quick - don't worry, you can't harm the motor by doing the following. </p> <p>Take your multimeter and set it either to continuity measurement or to resistance measurement. Either one will work - if you have the option for continuity measurements, choose that one though as they often offer a little buzzer which makes a sound when continuity is given. </p> <p>Unplug the motor (of course) and hold one of the two probes of the multimeter to one of the pins of the 6 pin connector of the motor. I personally like to start at the left side, so hold one probe onto the very left pin.<br> Then use the other probe and touch the other pins - one after another.<br> Make sure that both tips of your probes really make contact to the desired pins. Once you found the corresponding pin for the very left sided pin you placed your first probe onto, mark that.<br> Then move the probe to the next pin and repeat the process.<br> In the end you'll come up with having two 'paired' pins identified - each pair belongs to one coil. </p> <p>For illustration purposes, the following picture shows the coils of a motor from a Kobra Neo and a Creality motor. </p> <p><img alt="Marked motor pins" src=../../assets/images/axes_y-motor_stock-creality_pinout-marked_web.jpg> </p> <p>If the pairing of your probed pins is the same - fine, you can connect the motor right away. </p> <p>If the pairing is different, like at the Creality motor shown in the picture, you need to pull out two wires of the connector of the motor cable (one wire of one coil each!), switch them accordingly and insert them back in the connector housing.<br> At the shown example with the stock vs. the Creality motor, you'd just switch the position of the two inner wires here. </p> <p>You can pull out the wires (inclduing the attached metal contacts) by pressing down a tiny metal latch of that contact.<br> Take something like a needle or a tiny screwdriver for that. Gently press that latch down and slightly pull on the wire - the wire with the contact being attached will come out.<br> Once you put it into the correct position, just push it back into the belonging hole - but mind the orientation! You might hear a little "click" sound, but check if the wire really got into position by looking after that latch and by pulling at the wire - it shouldn't come out. </p> <p>After a final check if everything is still ok, connect the motor - it should work now. </p> <p>If it happens that the polarity of the coils/wiring is wrong, you'll experience a stuttering and probably noise-making motor. In that case proceed as above and switch the wiring accordingly. </p> </details> <hr> <h3 id=linear-rail-system>Linear Rail System<a class=headerlink href=#linear-rail-system title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3> <p>The X axis has a linear rail motion system instead of POM wheels like many other machines.<br> It's not a 'real' linear rail like a MGN12 system for example though - instead, Acnycubic is using U-shaped metal SG15 bearings running along round-shaped metal rails which are being mounted in the v-slots of the x-axis gantry's aluminum rail.<br> The following picture shows this rail system (without the printhead being mounted to the plate). </p> <p><img alt="X rail system" src=../../assets/images/axes_K2Pro_X-rail-system-nohead_web.jpg> </p> <hr> <h4 id=sg15-bearings-position>SG15 Bearings Position<a class=headerlink href=#sg15-bearings-position title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4> <p>The metal wheels of the printhead's mounting plate, the SG15 bearings, are leading the printhead along the aluminum profile of the x-axis (the so-called "x-axis gantry").<br> These bearings run along a round-shaped metal rail and therefore they should sit in an optimal position. <br> The following picture shows the back side of the meatl plate the printhead is mounted to. You can see two SG15 bearings at the top and one at the bottom. </p> <p><img alt="Plate back side" src=../../assets/images/head_K2Pro_mounting-plate-backside_web.jpg></p> <p><em>You can adjust the position and therefore the overall pressure of the bearings against the metal rail of only <strong><em>one</em></strong> bearing by turning the eccentric nut which moves the bearing either towards or away from the metal rail.</em> </p> <p><em>The bearing whose position can be adjusted is the one located at the <strong><em>bottom</em></strong> - the two wheels at the top which are running across the upper side of the x-axis gantry can't be adjusted as there aren't any eccentric nuts mounted!</em> </p> <p><img alt="Eccentric nut at printhead mounting plate" src=../../assets/images/axes_K2Pro_X-plate_eccentric-nut_bottomview_web.jpg> </p> <details class=info> <summary>What Is An Eccentric Nut?</summary> <p>The following picture shows an eccentric nut (in this case mounted to a POM wheel) which I painted to make the special shape of it more visible. </p> <p><img alt="Eccentric nut" src=../../assets/images/eccentric-nut_web.jpg> </p> <p>The following picture shows an eccentric nut on it's own.<br> <img alt="Ecc nut solo" src=../../assets/images/eccentric_nut2_web.jpeg> </p> <p>As you hopefully can see, the bolt isn't centered - so if you turn that eccentric nut while being mounted, the position of the bolt and therefore the whole bearing will be changed, either towards or away from the rail it's sitting at. </p> </details> <p>For a better understanding of these parts, the following picture shows them being dismounted from the gantry with the SG15 bearing still being attached. </p> <p><img alt="Ecc nuts vs posts" src=../../assets/images/ecc-nut_vs_bolt_web.jpeg> </p> <p>The bearings shouldn't sit too tight onto the rail but also not too loose.<br> On the other hand, they also shouldn't be too loose or far away from the rail which would lead to instability - the gantry shouldn't wiggle but it has to be able to move freely and without much of a force being applied. <br> So, in a summary: the SG15 bearings should touch the rail and sit on it well without any noticeable amount of play which would cause a wiggeling, but they should still be able to move smoothly.<br> The following picture shows a bearing which is too far away from the rail, you can clearly see the huge gap between the rail and the grove of the bearing (circled in red). On the right you can see properly positioned bearing which sits perfectly on the rail (circled in green) - don't mind the tiny gap there, that's due to the shape of both parts which don't fit 100%. </p> <p><img alt="SG15 positioned" src=../../assets/images/SG15_positions_web.jpg> </p> <p>When adjusting the position, don't only judge by the look though, as that could lead to a bearing which is running way too tight and therefore an increased amount of friction and higher degree of wear &amp; tear. </p> <p>Besides their position on the rail itself, make sure the bearings and the posts/nuts/bolts are assembled correctly and line up with the rail as well - if they're out of alignment and don't run correctly along the rail, you'll experience a massive wear and tear as well. </p> <hr> <h4 id=maintenance_1>Maintenance<a class=headerlink href=#maintenance_1 title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4> <p>As the bearings as well as the rods will suffer from metal running on metal and debris can build up, clean the rails and the bearings from time to time.<br> Inspect all parts for any visible damage, check if the SG15 wheels are still in the correct position and if they turn well or if maybe a bearing became bad. <br> After that, add a slight coating of lubrification to reduce the wear and tear due to the fact that metal is running on metal - I personally use "Super Lube" for that. </p> <div class="admonition warning"> <p class=admonition-title>Wear And Tear</p> <p>Wear and tear does occur at this kind of linear rail system as well, as metal bearings are running along a metal rod.<br> In the beginning you'll probably notice some black dust coming off the rail and the shiny coating isn't that shiny anymore as shown in the following picture. </p> <p><img alt="Rails wear & tear" src=../../assets/images/axes_K2Pro_rail-wear%26tear_web.jpg></p> <p>When things get worse, you'll see the chrome coating coming off completely as shown in the following picture. </p> <p><img alt="Rails harmed" src=../../assets/images/axes_K2Pro_rail-heavy-wear%26tear_web.jpeg> </p> <p>There are (imho) three main reasons which cause this issue and which highly affect how fast this damage occurs: </p> <ol> <li>First to mention would be an insufficient lubrification.<br> So make sure to clean off old grease and apply fresh grease regularly. The more you're using the machine, the more often you have to do this maintenance! </li> <li>Second to mention is improper alignment and running the bearings too tight onto the rail.<br> So make sure you position the SG15 bearings correctly. </li> <li>Third is the common behaviour of placing and printing smaller parts in the center of the build plate.<br> So place smaller parts in different areas of the bed instead of always locating them right in the center. The more the bearings are running across a specific section of the rails, the more the abrasion will occur in that area. </li> </ol> </div> <details class=example> <summary>Replacing The Linear Rods</summary> <p>If it happens that the rods of this linear rail system got harmed, you can actually push them out of the aluminum rail's v.slot, turn them a bit and push them back in.<br> This might take some effort, but it's possible to do so.<br> If you have to do this procedure, make sure you can access both ends of the aluminum rail freely. Means, dismount any caps, belt tensioner, motors or whatever is in the way.<br> Then take a hammer and something like a wide flathead screwdriver or (even better) a bolt or so. Place the bolt onto the end of the rod you want to push out and <em>carefully</em> use the hammer on the bolt. By doing so you can push out the rod. </p> <p><em>Make sure to not deform the end of the rod!

This also leads to a wobbly and sagging/lagging x-axis gantry at the unsupported right side, as you'll most likely be able to move the right part (the side without the lead screw) up and down a bit. <br> Whatever you'll try with the eccentric nut of the wheel of the inside (because there's only this one), you won't be able to achieve that all of the three wheels touch the aluminum and sit in the slot like they should, as the eccentric nut only changes the position of the inner wheel towards the frame.<br> So - what to do?<br> Well, there's a 'trick': you need to align those Y-shaped metal brackets where the wheels are mounted to - which directly leads us to the process of <a href=#tramming-the-x-axis-gantry>tramming the x-axis gantry</a>. </p> <p>The following picture shows one of those Y-shaped brackets I'm referring to - in this case it's the one from the Kobra Neo (as I didn't disassemble the x-gantry at my Kobra 2 Neo yet), but the principle is the same.<br> They're mounted to each end of the x-axis gantry. </p> <p><img alt="Y-shaped bracket" src=../../assets/images/axes_Y-bracket_web.jpg> </p> <hr> <h4 id=maintenance_2>Maintenance<a class=headerlink href=#maintenance_2 title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4> <p>As the wheels will suffer from running on the aluminum and debris can build up, clean the aluminum and the wheels itself from time to time. </p> <p>If you see debris building up pretty quick, it's most likely because the wheels are running too tight in the v-slot of the aluminum and therefore it's too much friction which leads to a quick wearout.<br> Another factor is a possible misalignment here, so that they aren't running well along in the slot, so check the position of the wheels as well. </p> <p>See the following picture where you can clearly see a heavy wear and tear.<br> The picture is taken from the mounting plate of the printhead of a Kobra Neo, but the wear and tear will be the same at POM wheels located at different spots.<br> According to the user who took this picture, this is the state after three days of usage - which is absolutely <em>not</em> "normal". </p> <p><img alt="Wheels wear & tear" src=../../assets/images/axes_wheels-weartear_web.jpeg> </p> <p>So if your wheels look like this, check the position of the wheels! </p> <p>Also check the wheels for any visible defects, like a harmed profile as shown in the following picture. </p> <p><img alt="Harmed wheels" src=../../assets/images/POM-wheel_harmed_web.jpg> </p> <p>Wheels can also become indented, especially when they're sitting too tight in the v-slot of the rail and if the printer hasn't been used for a while.<br> Dents can be quite hard to identify, so take a close look. </p> <p>Another, actually quite common but overseen problem are defective ball bearings. Since the used bearings aren't expensive high-quality ones, they can be defective right away. You can't <em>see</em> a defective ball bearing though, you can only <em>feel</em> it when moving the wheel/bearing along the rail or across a flat surface. </p> <p>Both of the above, harmed wheels as well as bad bearings, cause regularly recurring 'hiccups' when the wheel is being rolled along the v-slot rail or across a flat surface. <br> <em>This problem becomes bigger the tighter the wheels are running in the v-slot of the rail.

Since linear rails don't dampen movements as well, this factor doesn't weigh that much though. But: since the material itself is harder, PC wheels can easily crack if their position is too tight in the v-slot of the rail - so when using PC wheels, be careful and pay even more attention to the perfect position! </p> <hr> <h3 id=tramming-the-x-axis-gantry>Tramming The X-Axis Gantry<a class=headerlink href=#tramming-the-x-axis-gantry title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3> <details class=warning> <summary>'Tramming' vs. 'Leveling' The Gantry</summary> <p>Because I got attacked, harrassed, insulted and called names for using the correct term "tramming" instead of the misleading and technically wrong term "leveling", let me make something clear at this point. </p> <p>What we do here is a procedure called "tramming". We (try) to get the machine and certain parts of it aligned perfectly, like axes and parts being square, parallel, perpendicular and equidistant <em>towards each other</em>.<br> For example, we try to set up the frame being mounted perfectly square, the z-axis frame being perpendicular to the base frame, the x-axis gantry being perpendicular to the z-axis frame and the bed being parallel and equidistant to the x-axis gantry and the printhead/nozzle.<br> It's a technical term which is also used at CNC machines for example and this is the correct nomenclature. And as a matter of fact, this is also the case with 3d printers. Point. </p> <p>"Leveling" though is the process of bringing something like a shelf, a table or a framed picture hanging at the wall into the position that it's <em>perpendicular to gravity</em> so to say. Most of the time you do so by taking a bubble level or a self-leveling laser. <em>But this is NOT how you 'level' the bed of your 3d printer for example!</em> </p> <p>Yes, I'm highly aware of the fact that the majority of the 3d printing community uses the term 'leveling', that people say "Level your bed!" and that the marketing guys and gals of the companies use the (even more misleading!) term "Automatic Bed Leveling" (which is even worse as it suggests that the process will actually 'level' the bed itself - which it obviously doesn't). But that doesn't mean that I have to follow that misleading road. <br> So besides the fact that this isn't the correct nomenclature (seriously, I'm not the grammar police - I'm a German guy who speaks a little bit of English..), my 'problem' with this term is that it's just really misleading! </p> <p>How many beginners are pulling out their bubble level, put it on the bed or the x-axis gantry to check if it's leveled and maybe even shim out the table the printer stands on - just to come to the conclusion that their bed or gantry is leveled?<br> Believe it or not: many - whether you came across those users while trying to help them or not. You can use a 3d printer on a tilted table - if the printer is trammed, it'll still print fine. </p> <p><em>So to all those haters out there: yes, I will continue to use the correct term "tramming", no matter how much you'll attack and try to insult me.</em><br> And no, I don't do it because I want to show the world that I know the correct term, I do it because I want to avoid that beginners become frustrated because they just get it wrong.<br> And if you haters would start to actually do the same, then maybe one day there might occur a shift in the 'consciousness' of the community and the correct term would be used on a regular basis. Seriously, try to <em>help</em> people out by just using the correct term for making them realize that it's <em>not</em> about how perpendicular the bed or gantry is towards gravity - and stop harrassing people who already do so. </p> </details> <p>It's advisable to tram the x-axis gantry to either the bed itself or the frame, depending on the type of spacers of the bedmount. By doing so, you make sure that the bed and the gantry are parallel to each other and therefore the distance of the nozzle to the plate is pretty much the same all along the x-axis. </p> <p>As the printer comes with rigid spacers (the cylindric metal pieces between the bedplate and the bed gantry), you aren't really able to "tram" the bed unless you replace the stock spacers with <a href=../bed/#different-spacers>adjustable ones</a> - which I personally <em>won't</em> suggest to do at this machine, regarding the high speed and accelerations this machine is running. <br> The problem with those rigid stock spacers is, that they might not be all of the same length/height - so I'd recommend to at least dismount them, check if they're all of the same height and if they aren't, sand them down to an equal height. By doing so you can at least make sure that you won't have a tilted or warped bed caused by spacers of different legth. See the section <a href=../bed/#tramming-the-bed>"Tramming The Bed"</a> for further information and instructions. <br> <em>Make sure to take care of this before actually starting to tram the x-axis gantry, as you'll tram it in relation to the bed.</em> </p> <p>After taking care of the spacers (either the stock ones or after getting yourself new adjustable ones), reassemble everything. Now you can proceed tramming the x-axis gantry: </p> <ul> <li>If you're using the <em>rigid stock spacers</em>, tram the gantry in relation to the <em>bed</em> itself. </li> <li>If you're using <em>adjustable spacers</em>, tram the gantry in relation to the <em>frame</em> itself and then tram the bed in relation to the nozzle at different positions (see the section <a href=../bed/#tramming-the-bed>"Tramming The Bed"</a> for further information and instructions about it). </li> </ul> <p>Please see the expandable textbox below for further instructions about how to tram the x-axis gantry. </p> <details class=example> <summary>Tramming The X-Axis Gantry And Adjusting The Wheels</summary> <p>When it comes down to tramming the x-axis gantry, up to me one should differ between tramming it in relation to the frame of the printer and in relation to the bed. Depending on which spacers are being used, you should either do the one or the other: </p> <ol> <li> <p>Tram <strong>in relation to the bed</strong>, if you're using the stock spacers, because you can't really "tram" the bed itself.<br> <em>Make sure you checked the rigid stock spacers of the bedmount for an equal height before tramming the gantry though!</em> If they're not all of the same height, I'd recommend to sand them down to the height of the shortest spacer. </p> </li> <li> <p>If you've swapped the stock spacers and are using <em>adjustable</em> ones, like silicone spacers or springs, then you should tram in <strong>relation to the frame</strong> itself to make sure everything is square and perpendicular like it should be. <em>Of course the whole frame has to be assembled correctly first, so make sure the base frame really is mounted square and the aluminum parts of the z-axis frame really are perpendicular to the base frame!</em> <br> In this case follow the steps being mentioned in the following, <strong>but instead of placing two identical objects onto the bed, place them onto the base frame</strong> and rest the aluminum part of the x-axis gantry onto them. After bringing those y-shaped metal brackets into the correct position, make sure to retighten the screws while the aluminum frame of the x-axis is perpendicular to the aluminum frame of the z-axis at both sides.<br> After that, tram the bed itself to the x-axis gantry by adjusting the height of the bed by using the screws and adjust it at the four corners to the same distance of the nozzle (e.g. 0.1mm by using a feeler gauge or a sheet of paper). </p> </li> </ol> <p><em>Note: the following description is for tramming the x-axis gantry in <strong><em>relation to the bed</em></strong> itself when using the rigid stock spacers!</em><br> <em>If you're using adjustable spacers, the procedure is pretty much the same, you just have to put two pieces of equal height onto the frame of the printer (where the z-axis aluminum frame is mounted onto) and rest the x-axis gantry onto them instead of placing those pieces on the bed itself!</em> </p> <p><strong>For being able to access the belonging parts and screws for the following tramming process, you need to turn the printer around so that you face the backside of it.</strong><br> I personally prefer to also take off the printhead for this procedure, just to not have it in the way, but you don't have to do it. </p> <p><em>The following description is about the process without taking out the lead screws completely. However, if you didn't take care of cleaning and lubing the lead screws yet as well as checking the whole z-axis lead screw system for perfect vertical alignment and the anti-backlash nuts for a correct installation, this is the perfect time to do so!</em> </p> <p><strong><em>Take your time for this!<br> Read attentively, best would be to read this whole description before even attempting the actual tramming process.<br> Follow the steps and be as precise as you can be!</em></strong> </p> <ul> <li> <p>In order to <strong>tram the x-axis gantry in relation to the bed</strong>, so that both are as parallel as possible, take two parts of equal height like cans for example and place them onto the left and right side of the bed. </p> </li> <li> <p>Drive the x-gantry up/down until it's about 5mm lower that the cans. </p> </li> <li>Take out the two screws which attach the anti-backlash nuts to their respective mounting brackets at the x-gantry, so that you can move the x-gantry upwards without the anti-backlash nut being attached. </li> <li>Loosen the grub/set screws of the pulleys at the top of the screws where the timing belt runs across.<br> By doing these two steps you achieve that there isn't any kind of force being added to any side of the gantry which will lead to a false result.<br> You want the gantry to rest on the cans <em>only</em> by it's own weight! </li> <li>Now lift the gantry your hand and slide the two cans underneath it.<br> <em>Don't spin the lead screws to raise the gantry!</em> </li> <li>Place the cans to the very left and right side of the bedplate.<br> Make sure to have the cans positioned as far to the sides of the bed as possible. Also make sure to push them backwards so that <em>only the rod of the linear rail of the gantry touches them!</em> <br> This is crucial - you <em>don't</em> want those y-shaped metal brackets touch the cans at all! </li> <li>Now lower the gantry carefully until it rests on the cans <em>with the rod of that linear rail</em> at the underside of that aluminum rail of the gantry. </li> <li>Check if the 'noses' of the anti-backlash nuts still sit in that notch of those y-shaped metal brackets how it should be while there's still a little gap between the upper side of them and the corresponding mounting brackets. See the following picture for a better understanding what I'm talking about.<br> <img alt="Loose nut" src=../../assets/images/axes_K2Pro_nut-loose_marked_web.jpg><br> If it's <em>not</em> the case and the nuts are either too low (so that those 'noses' aren't sitting in that notch) or too high (so that there isn't a gap between them and the mounting bracket), slowly turn the lead of that side accordingly until it looks like in the picture shown above. </li> <li>Once you're done with that, pay close attention to the position of the gantry on those cans.<br> The following picture shows the slightly crooked gantry resting on one can (the left one), where there's a noticeable gap between it and the can on the right side.<br> <img alt="Crooked gantry on cans" src=../../assets/images/axes_K2Pro_X-gantry_untrammed_marked_web.jpg> </li> <li> <p>Now loosen the two hexagon socket screws at each side of the aluminum frame of the gantry which are holding each of the Y-shaped metal plates (where the wheels are mounted onto, at the backside so to say) against it. Don't take them out (!), just loosen them a bit.<br> The following pictures show the locations of those screws.<br> <img alt="Gantry screws left" src=../../assets/images/axes_K2Pro_gantry-bracket-screws-marked1_web.jpg> | <img alt="Gantry screws right" src=../../assets/images/axes_K2Pro_gantry-bracket-screws-marked2_web.jpg> </p> </li> <li> <p>The goal now is to bring these brackets into position so that the rail of this x-gantry completely rests on those cans like the following picture shows.<br> <img alt="X-axis gantry" src=../../assets/images/axes_K2Pro_X-gantry_trammed_web.jpg> <br> For achieving this, you now might have to wiggle and trun the brackets a bit to get everything aligned up well. </p> </li> <li> <p>The following picture illustrates the following steps for achieving the perfect position of those Y-shaped brackets (yes, it's the Y-shaped metal bracket of the Kobra Neo, but the principle is absolutely the same). <br> <img alt="Illustration how to adjust the brackets" src=../../assets/images/axes_gantry_bracket-position_web.jpg><br> <em>Important note: with adjusting the position of the inner wheels by turning the eccentric nut (now and later as well), you only adjust the pressure and how tight the wheels sit and run along the z-axis frame. The position of the outer wheels only can be achieved by positioning them manually as described.</em> </p> </li> <li> <p>With those brackets being loose, adjust their position by slightly wiggling and turning them until the outer wheels of them touch the aluminum frame of the z-axis. Do one bracket at each time.<br> Don't pay (too much) attention to the inner wheel yet though, as you'll adjust the position of it in the following step.<br> <em>Remember: right now you want to achieve that the bracket is in the position that both of the two outer wheels touch the aluminum frame!</em> <br> Once you found that perfect position of that bracket, hold it in place with one hand, press down the rail of that x-gantry onto the cans once again for making sure it rests on both of them and then tighten the two bolts again to secure the brackets in it's position while still holding the bracket into position.<br> Do this for both sides.<br> Once done with this, make sure the x-gantry still rests on the cans equally. </p> </li> <li> <p>Now adjust the position of the inner wheels by turning the eccentric nuts in the correct position. You want to achieve that all three wheels touch the frame.<br> Make sure to not position those inner wheels too tight against that rail - it should sit good in that v-slot, but you don't want to tighten them up too much which would cause too much resistance and unnecessary wear and tear.<br> Do this for both sides.<br> The following picture shows an eccentric nut which I painted to make the special shape of it more visible.<br> <img alt="Eccentric nut" src=../../assets/images/eccentric-nut_web.jpg> <br> As you hopefully can see, the bolt isn't centered - so if you turn that eccentric nut while being mounted, the position of the bolt and therefore the whole wheel will be changed, either towards or away from the v-slot of the rail it's sitting at. </p> </li> <li> <p>After you did this, pay attention to the rod of that linear rail of the x-axis gantry once again - you want it to rest completely equal on both cans as shown again in the following picture.<br> <img alt="X-axis gantry" src=../../assets/images/axes_K2Pro_X-gantry_trammed_web.jpg> </p> </li> <li> <p>Now all of the wheels should touch the aluminum frame of the z-axis and the x-axis gantry should be as parallel to the bed as possible. The y-shaped brackets should be at pretty much the same position as well. </p> </li> <li> <p>Now that the brackets, wheels and the whole gantry is trammed perfectly, <em>carefully</em> turn each lead screw so that the anti-backlash nut is coming upwards again.<br> <em>Pay close attention as you only want to drive it up until the point that it just touches the bracket - you DON'T want to drive it any further which would lift up that specific side of the gantry!</em> <br> Once they are in place, put the screws back in and mount the anti-backlash nuts back to their brackets. </p> </li> <li> <p>Once done with that, check the position of the gantry once again. If everythings still looks fine and the rod of the linear rail still touches both cans equally, tighten up the grub/set screws of those pulleys at the top. </p> </li> <li> <p>When everything is set up again, move the z-axis up and down by using the control unit.

If it's too tight, too much pressure will be put onto the motor shaft which will do physical harm, the belt can snap etc. - if it's too loose though, the belt might even slip. Either state (too tensioned and too loose) can cause artifacts. </p> <p>My 'rule of thumb' here is: if you can bend the belt down a bit by applying some pressure with your finger onto it but you still feel a good amount of resistance, then it's a good sign that you're in the right area of tension. So start from there and if you feel or need to do so, play around with different belt tensions while printing the same bject over and over again for finding the best tension for your setup. </p> <details class=info> <summary>Some Notes On Belt Tension</summary> <p>People often recommend "Tighten your belts!", but that's actually not always the solution if artifacts like layer shifts occur.<br> As a matter of fact, I made many different tests with my Kobra Neos and evaluated the different influences of factors like belt tension, wheel position, quality of ball bearings of the wheels, a trammed vs. untrammed frame/printer setup and so on. And to be honest: a belt being too loose in terms of being the cause for severe problems only occured when it was really <em>that</em> loose that even someone who has no experience at all with this would notice it. If a belt is sagging, I'd assume that a user would notice that and realizes that this can't be good. </p> <p>Don't get me wrong - <em>of course</em> different tensions of the belts <em>do</em> have a certain influence of the quality of the print, and it might be worth to finetune the tension for getting the last little amount of perfection out of your print.<br> And yes, of course, if a belt is too loose, then it can slip or it can cause layer shifts due to a slight 'lag' which occurs when the motors start to drive the belt or when a sudden change of the direction occurs.<br> But: a belt being too tight can cause artifacts as well. Not only that - it can and actually will harm the hardware. Users reported not only snapped belts or harmed motors, one even reported a bent bracket where the motor of the Y-axis was mount to. So, believe me or not: even though there are people in forums and on YouTube who claim that a belt can't be too tight - it definitely can. </p> <p>Using the abovementioned 'method' of roughly setting your belt tension to a 'medium' value, I found that other factors have a much bigger impact on the print quality and the reliability and well-functioning of the whole printer.<br> Let me give you two short examples to show you what I mean: </p> <ul> <li>If your v-slot wheels or SG15 bearings are too tight, of course you also need to increase the belt tension - but in that case it's not the belt tension what's causing the issue in the first place, it's the wrong position of the wheels. </li> <li>If you have bad ball bearings at the wheels (which is actually most likely the case due to the cheap parts being used) or SG15 rollers, then those may cause an irregular/inconsistent movement of the wheels and you can feel regular 'hiccups' while moving the belonging part (like the bedgantry or the printhead). You can <em>feel</em> how you have to apply more force at certain spots when moving the part manually by hand, as it feels like it's getting stuck at certain spots. So a belt being too loose isn't the cause of the problem here and therefore tightening up your belt isn't the solution - replacing the bad bearings with some quality ones is. </li> </ul> <p>So, use your brain and don't always follow the typical answers like "Tighten you belts!" when you're experiencing issues like layer shifts for example. Instead, look at your printer more 'holistic' and see the different parts which are working together in the end. Pay attention to each of them, once again starting by inspecting the frame and making sure everything is still trammed and set up well here. Due to vibrations and repetitive motions screws can come loose, parts can and will wear out and therefore a frame or other parts you set up a while ago can and will come out of alignment by time.</p> </details> <hr> <h4 id=maintenance_3>Maintenance<a class=headerlink href=#maintenance_3 title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h4> <p>You should inspect the belts and the belonging parts like pulleys etc from time to time to make sure everything is in a good condition and nothing will suddenly break. </p> <p><strong>Belt</strong> </p> <ul> <li>Check the belt tension from time to time as it might wear out and lengthen a bit. </li> <li>Check the teeth of the belt if they are still good looking or if they're worn out or if even some teethe are missing.</li> <li>Check if you can see any cracks or other damage at the belt.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Pulleys</strong></p> <ul> <li>Check the pulleys of the motors which are driving the belts.

Of course the belt itself can be physically harmed as well when grinding across sharp edges or when it gets old, but you should notice that when examining the belt every now and then when doing the regular maintenace of your printer. </p> <p>If you encounter a snapped belt, get yourself a good quality one as a replacement - don't go with the cheapest no-name product you can get.<br> I'd suggest to look out for an original "Gates Powergrip®" belt. You can get them in different lengths, like one or five meters.<br> Then get yourself some of those metal clamps you have to crimp at the ends of the belts as well. If you feel insecure about how to properly add those clamps to the belt and how to actually crimp them properly, practice crimping a few to your old broken belt. </p> <p>Crimp one of those clamps to one end of the belt, measure the belonging length of the belt and apply the other one, then cut off the rest of it.<br> Install the belt by disassembling the belonging parts like the belt tensioners (see the notes on how to do so in the belonging sections).<br> Pay attention to route the belt in the correct way and not being twisted and adjust the tension of the belt once everything is reassembled. </p> </details> <hr> <h3 id=y-axis-motor>Y-Axis Motor<a class=headerlink href=#y-axis-motor title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3> <p>The motor of the y-axis is a 42-48 Nema 17 stepper motor with a 16 teeth pulley being attached to the 5mm motor shaft.<br> It seems to be a regular 1.8° stepper, which means the shaft turns 1.8° at each steps, and therefore it's doing 200 steps per one full 360° rotation. </p> <p><img alt="Y-axis motor" src=../../assets/images/axes_K2Pro_Y-motor_web.jpg> </p> <p><img alt="Y-axis motor number" src=../../assets/images/axes_K2Pro_Y-motor_back_web.jpg> </p> <div class="admonition warning"> <p class=admonition-title>Attention When Connecting A 'Generic' Motor!</p> <p>As there aren't any specifications and replacement motors from Anycubic being available, you should be able to use any 'generic' motor with the beforementioned specs.<br> <em>Before connecting it to the mainboard though, take your multimeter and identify the coils by probing the pins of the motor's connector!</em><br> Compare your findings with the ones from the stock motor - you might have to switch the position of certain wires inside of the plug. </p> </div> <details class=example> <summary>Identifying The Coils And Connections</summary> <p>When you want to use a different motor than the stock ones, it's most likely the case that the coils are connected to different pins of the 6 pin connector of the motor.<br> The best would be if you take a multimeter and probe the pins to see which ones belong to a coil. So let me go over this procedure really quick - don't worry, you can't harm the motor by doing the following. </p> <p>Take your multimeter and set it either to continuity measurement or to resistance measurement. Either one will work - if you have the option for continuity measurements, choose that one though as they often offer a little buzzer which makes a sound when continuity is given. </p> <p>Unplug the motor (of course) and hold one of the two probes of the multimeter to one of the pins of the 6 pin connector of the motor. I personally like to start at the left side, so hold one probe onto the very left pin.<br> Then use the other probe and touch the other pins - one after another.<br> Make sure that both tips of your probes really make contact to the desired pins. Once you found the corresponding pin for the very left sided pin you placed your first probe onto, mark that.<br> Then move the probe to the next pin and repeat the process.<br> In the end you'll come up with having two 'paired' pins identified - each pair belongs to one coil. </p> <p>For illustration purposes, the following picture shows the coils of a motor from a Kobra Neo and a Creality motor. </p> <p><img alt="Marked motor pins" src=../../assets/images/axes_y-motor_stock-creality_pinout-marked_web.jpg> </p> <p>If the pairing of your probed pins is the same - fine, you can connect the motor right away. </p> <p>If the pairing is different, like at the Creality motor shown in the picture, you need to pull out two wires of the connector of the motor cable (one wire of one coil each!), switch them accordingly and insert them back in the connector housing.<br> At the shown example with the stock vs. the Creality motor, you'd just switch the position of the two inner wires here. </p> <p>You can pull out the wires (inclduing the attached metal contacts) by pressing down a tiny metal latch of that contact.<br> Take something like a needle or a tiny screwdriver for that. Gently press that latch down and slightly pull on the wire - the wire with the contact being attached will come out.<br> Once you put it into the correct position, just push it back into the belonging hole - but mind the orientation! You might hear a little "click" sound, but check if the wire really got into position by looking after that latch and by pulling at the wire - it shouldn't come out. </p> <p>After a final check if everything is still ok, connect the motor - it should work now. </p> <p>If it happens that the polarity of the coils/wiring is wrong, you'll experience a stuttering and probably noise-making motor.

If you're interested in a more precise and proper technical description of how exactly a stepper motor works, please search the web for an adequate source.<br> For a better understanding of the following description, see the following picture which shows the inside of a stepper motor.<br> <img alt="Motor inside" src=../../assets/images/motor_inside_web.jpeg> </p> <p>We have motors which execute 200 <em>full steps</em> to rotate the shaft of the motor for a full 360° rotation, where each step is a movement of 1.8° (there are also 'high resolution' stepper motors which do 400 steps with 0.9° movement per full step, but we have motors which do the mentioned 200 steps). This is based on how the motor is built in the inside with it's permanent magnet motor and the stator coils which make the shaft of the motor turn in the end. <br> At each of these 200 steps with 1.8° movement, the motor 'rests' in that specific position due to the positions of the permanent magnets in the inside. Means, these positions are 'given', there don't occur any deviations or misalignments. </p> <p>Then we have <em>microstepping</em>. Microstepping is dividing one full step in a number of smaller steps, the so called microsteps. In our case we have 16 microsteps being used (other setups can use up to 256 microsteps). For making this mircostepping possible, the belonging stepper motor driver (which is a chip on the mainboard, in this case a TMC2209) adjusts the current of the stator coil in a way that the permanent magnet motor will be hold in a position between two full steps. So the motor doesn't 'rest' in a certain position due to the force of the magnets, it's being 'hold' in an intermediate position between two magnets which are next to each other so to say.<br> In our case with a 1.8° rotation per full step and 16 subsequent microsteps, each microstep is a movement of 0.0025mm, because one full step is 0.04mm.<br> But, due to the fact that the motor is being 'hold' in that position between two magnets like it's floating, this movement isn't 100% precise. So in reality it's not <em>exactly</em> altering it's position of 0.0025mm when a microstep is executed, it's more like it's moving <em>approximately</em> 0.0025mm.<br> And this is already the reason why it's smart to choose a layer height which is a multiple of <em>full steps</em>, just because the movement is more 'precise' due to the fact that the motor moves from magnet to magnet instead of being hold in a somewhat-position in between.<br> There are other additional reasons as well like that the torque is heavily reduced when microstepping, but I won't go into further details about that. </p> <p>Now that you know the basic principle of how a stepper motor works and what the difference of a full step and a microstep is, you might wonder why the up and down movement of the z-axis is 0.04mm for a full step now. <br> Here's the 'math' behind it: </p> <ul> <li>The stepper motor of the z-axis does 200 steps per revolution (1.8° per full step for a 360° rotation).</li> <li>The lead screw is 8mm in diameter. </li> <li>There are 4 starts (= thread paths) at the lead screw. </li> <li>The lead screw has 2mm pitch. </li> <li>4 starts multiplied by 2mm pitch is 8mm lead per one <em>full</em> rotation of the lead screw. In other words: for every 360° rotation the motor shaft and therefore the lead screw does, the z-axis moves (either up or down) 8mm. <br> Therefore we have the 8mm lead divided by 200 steps per revolution, which then results in <em>0.04mm movement per step</em>. </li> </ul> <p>Doing the math, you'll realize that e.g. 0.16mm layer height = 4 full steps, 0.2mm l.h. = 5 full steps and so on.<br> Now we remember that a microstep is ~0.0025mm.<br> So when choosing a layer height like e.g. 0.15mm, the motor has to do 3 full steps (3*0.04mm=0.12mm) and 12 microsteps (12*0.0025mm=0.03mm).<br> But because a microstep is a position which is somewhat 'floating' due to the fact that it's being held between two magnets instead of 'resting' in a position facing one magnet, the chosen 0.15mm layer height is not as precise as the 0.16mm or 0.2mm which is a multiple of 0.04mm full steps. Therefore it's smart to always choose layer heights which can be fully divided by 0.04mm. </p> <p>Now you probably ask yourself if it really affects the outcome of the printed part in the end and if it's worth it paying attention to this, and imho the answer "maybe not that much" and "yes".<br> You <em>probably</em> won't be able to tell the difference in terms of quality when looking at two parts with the bare eye.<br> But what's the advantage of using a layer height of 0.15mm (where a somewhat unprecise microstepping has to be used) instead of just choosing 0.16mm layer height (which consists of full steps)? Exactly - there isn't any advantage. So, imho: yes, it's worth paying attention to this, because if we can somewhat improve the quality and accuracy of a print by just making one smart decision - then why shouldn't we do it? </p> </details> <hr> <h3 id=lead-screws>Lead Screws<a class=headerlink href=#lead-screws title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3> <p>The lead screws are T8x8 type of lead screws, means they are 8mm in diameter with 8mm lead ('distance' of one complete rotation), 2mm pitch and 4 starts.

Check The Position Of The Top Bearing Blocks</summary> <p>When you experience a sloppy timing belt, you might be tempted to add an adjustable tensioner/idler pulley for being able to tension it.

At least at my machine it was the case, and after adjusting the positions the belt had a sufficient tension - which makes me assume that the length of the belt itself which is being used is actually correct.<br> So before adding a tensioner pulley to the top, I'd suggest to do the following in the first place: </p> <ul> <li>Measure the inner distance between the two lead screws at the bottom, right above the coupler and the bottom bearing block. I measure between the sides of the threaded part which are facing towards the bed. At my Kobra 2 Pro the distance was about 274mm. </li> <li>Now measure the distance similarly at the very top. In my case the distance was 2mm less. </li> <li>Now measure the distance of each screw towards the outer (or inner) side of the Z-frame rail, again by starting at the very bottom.

The following picture shows a partially clogged thread due to debris of the anti-backlash nut. <br> <img alt="Debris in Thread" src=../../assets/images/axes_dirty-thread_web.jpg> <br> In this case the motor was still able to move the rod across it, but you could notice a tiny jerk at that point. </li> <li>If you need to clean it, it's advisable to disassamble the whole rod system including the coupler and the anti-backlash nut. The following picture shows the <strong>Neo</strong> where the coupler, rod and nut are dismounted. <br> <img alt="Dismounted z-axis" src=../../assets/images/axes_z-axis-dismounted_web.jpg> <br> See the other expandable box for some guidances about dis- and reassembling the z-axis lead screw system. </li> <li>Spray e.g. WD-40 on the rod to loosen old sticky oil and debris. Then take a toothbrush or something like that for being able to reach the bottom of the thread also and clean it up. Make sure to not leave any particles from the anti-backlash nut like shown in the picture below or any dirt stuck on it. <br> <img alt=Debris src=../../assets/images/axes_POMdebris_web.jpg></li> <li>After this procedure, clean the WD-40 off of the rod by using e.g. car break cleaner or silicone remover spray. It'll wash off everything, you can also use an old cloth to wipe it (but make sure that no textile fibres will stick in the thread somehow). </li> <li>After you cleaned and dried it, inspect the rod and the anti-backlash nut.<br> Are there any dents in the thread or any kind of deformation that shouldn't be there? Is it really straight or is it somehow bent (roll it across a flat surface)? If so, it would be best to get a new lead screw and replace it. <br> Is the anti-backlash nut worn out like in the picture shown below? If so, replace it, maybe use a brass one instead (note: until now I didn't find a brass one that fits the distance of the holes though). <br> <img alt="Worn out nut" src=../../assets/images/axes_worn-nut_web.jpg> <br> When you mount the anti-backlash nut to the belonging part of the frame, I personally like to not tighten up the screws completely to allow a bit of a movement on the horizontal plane. </li> <li>If everything is fine though and you want to mount the lead screw to the printer again, add a little lube to the rod. Don't be excessive here and drown it with oil - just use a tiny bit to make it glide better.<br> <em>Don't use WD-40 or grease which contains graphite or MoS2!</em> <br> I personally like to use PTFE spray first, let it dry and then put some synthetic lube on which is made for mountainbike chains as it uses to stick a bit better onto the metal. If you have, you can also use synthetic grease like PTFE or silicone grease ("Super Lube"), it should work even better.<br> You can draw a line of oil all along one side of the rod from the bottom to the top and then put the rod between your fingers and turn it. By doing so, the excessive oil will build up at your fingers and will also reach the bottom of the rod. Wipe off any excessive amount of oil afterwards again - you don't want to have oil dripping down on your motor later!<br> Tip: to avoid dripping oil down to the motor, I personally wrap a pipe cleaner around the rod right above the coupler. If by time a drop or two will move down, the pipe cleaner will absorb it. </li> <li>Before installing the rod into the coupler of the motor again, clean the last inch of the bottom again by using the car break cleaner and the cloth. Try to get it as much degreased as possible, so that it doesn't start to slip inside of the coupler later. </li> <li>When you're done reassembling everything and you home the printhead, you only should hear the low noise of the turning motor now - so now grinding noise from the anti-backlash nut or something like that. </li> </ul> <div class="admonition warning"> <p class=admonition-title>Don't Use WD-40 for Lubrication</p> <p>Do yourself a favour and <em>never</em> use WD-40 for <em>lubrication</em> as it's <em>not</em> a lubricant!<br> It's perfectly fine for washing off old oil from the threaded rod, but it's <em>not</em> a sufficient lubrification!<br> People use to think WD-40 is the perfect solution for pretty much everything, but they aren't aware of the fact that -due to the chemical recipe it's made of- it's absolutely not sufficient for getting parts lubed mid- to longterm. Fact is, that the chemicals inside of it will even wash off any grease or oil, it can harm POM and rubber and so on.<br> As an example: So let's say you want to lubricate your bike chain and use WD-40 to do so, you'll basically <em>wash away</em> the existent lubrification which is inside the chain - therefore the chain will be worn out pretty quick. You'll also harm the sealings. If you don't believe me, make a little test by yourself: take an air baloon, pump it up, spray WD-40 onto it and wait.. </p> </div> </details> <details class=example> <summary>Timing Belt Maintenace</summary> <p>You should inspect the timing belt and the belonging parts like pulleys and bearing blocks etc from time to time to make sure everything is in a good condition and nothing will suddenly break. </p> <ul> <li>Belt:</li> <li>Check the belt tension from time to time as it might wear out and lengthen a bit. </li> <li>Check the teeth of the belt if they are still good looking or if they're worn out or if even some teethe are missing.</li> <li> <p>Check if you can see any cracks or other damage at the belt.</p> </li> <li> <p>Pulleys: </p> </li> <li>Check the pulleys at the top which are driving the timing belt. Are they also looking ok? Did the grub/set screws become loose? </li> </ul> </details> <details class=example> <summary>Disassembling The Lead Screw System</summary> <p>If you need to disassemble the z-axis lead screw system, there are a few things that one should be aware of. Besides that, the necessary steps are pretty easy and self-explaing, so I'll go over them just really quick. </p> <ul> <li>First, you should somehow fixate the gantry of the x-axis to get the load off of the lead screw. You can do so by e.g. putting two soupcans onto the bed, each on one side (left/right) and then lower the gantry until it rests onto them. Or you can move the gantry up and fixate it with some velcro straps or cable ties to the blue plastic part at the top. </li> <li>Now unplug the wire from the stepper motor, just to be on the safe side. The printer itself is also switched off of course. </li> <li>Loosen the two screws at the coupler which conects the motor shaft and the lead screw. </li> <li>Now you can turn the lead screw by hand to screw it out of the anti-backlash nut. After you completely took it out, dismount the anti-backlash nut from the holder at the frame as well.<br> If you fixated the x-axis gantry at the top like shown in the picture above, you can also just screw the lead screw a bit higher into the anti-backlash nut so that it comes out of the coupler and then you just dismount the anti-backlash nut from the holder at the frame. After that you can take out the lead screw with the nut still on and take off the nut then. </li> <li>Take off the coupler from the motor shaft as well for being able to inspect everything. </li> </ul> </details> <details class=example> <summary>Reassembling The Lead Screw System</summary> <p>If you need to resassemble the z-axis lead screw system, there are a few things that one should be aware of. Besides that, the necessary steps are pretty easy and self-explaing, so I'll go over them just really quick. </p> <ul> <li>To reassemble everything, just follow your steps backwards. <br> However, there are a few things you should pay attention to now: </li> <li>Make sure the motor shaft and the bottom tip of the lead screw are free of oil or grease to avoid slipping of the coupler. </li> <li>Mount the coupler to the bottom of the lead screw first and tighten the screw. Then put it onto the motor shaft and tighten the screw. The coupler should not move or wiggle on either part. </li> <li>When installing the <em>anti-backlash nut</em>, make sure you <em>press it together</em> firmly while inserting the lead screw, so that the spring inside these two parts of the anti-backlash nut is completely compressed and loaded. </li> <li>Before finally installing the lead screw, loosen up the screws of the motor holder a bit so that the motor itself can move a bit on the horizontal plane.<br> Then install the lead screw, <em>align everything</em>, screw the anti-backlash nut (attention: don't forget to really press it together!) to the belonging holder and align the motor once again.<br> Then finally tighten up the screws of the motor mount.<br> By doing so you do the best you can to get the parts vertically aligned as much as possible. </li> </ul> </details> <hr> <p><a href=https://ko-fi.com/U6U5NPB51><img alt=ko-fi src=https://ko-fi.com/img/githubbutton_sm.svg></a> </p> </article> </div> </div> <a href=# class="md-top md-icon" data-md-component=top hidden> <svg xmlns=http://www.w3.org/2000/svg viewbox="0 0 24 24"><path d="M13 20h-2V8l-5.5 5.5-1.42-1.42L12 4.16l7.92 7.92-1.42 1.42L13 8v12Z"/></svg> Back to top </a> </main> <footer class=md-footer> <nav class="md-footer__inner md-grid" aria-label=Footer> <a href=../frame/ class="md-footer__link md-footer__link--prev" aria-label="Previous: Frame" rel=prev> <div class="md-footer__button md-icon"> <svg xmlns=http://www.w3.org/2000/svg viewbox="0 0 24 24"><path d="M20 11v2H8l5.5 5.5-1.42 1.42L4.16 12l7.92-7.92L13.5 5.5 8 11h12Z"/></svg> </div> <div class=md-footer__title> <div class=md-ellipsis> <span class=md-footer__direction> Previous </span> Frame </div> </div> </a> <a href=../bed/ class="md-footer__link md-footer__link--next" aria-label="Next: Bed" rel=next> <div class=md-footer__title> <div class=md-ellipsis> <span class=md-footer__direction> Next </span> Bed </div> </div> <div class="md-footer__button md-icon"> <svg xmlns=http://www.w3.org/2000/svg viewbox="0 0 24 24"><path d="M4 11v2h12l-5.5 5.5 1.42 1.42L19.84 12l-7.92-7.92L10.5 5.5 16 11H4Z"/></svg> </div> </a> </nav> <div class="md-footer-meta md-typeset"> <div class="md-footer-meta__inner md-grid"> <div class=md-copyright> <div class=md-copyright__highlight> Copyright &copy; 2023-2025 Ulf Dieckmann [ 3dneo (at) quantentunnel.de ] | <a href=https://www.flaticon.com/free-icons/3d-printer title="3d printer icons">3d printer icon created by Freepik - Flaticon</a> <br> If you find this page useful, please consider recommending it to others.
