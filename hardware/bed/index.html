just a PEI plate from a third party company, you need to get yourself a <em>230x230mm</em> plate, otherwise it would be too small!<br> As it seems that most parts out there are either 220x220mm or 235x235mm, get yourself the 235x235mm version then.

"NTC" stands for Negative Temperature Coefficient, which means that the resistance becomes lower when temperature rises. <br> "100k" NTC thermistor means that at a defined temperature of 25°C the resistance is 100k Ohm. The hotter the thermistor gets, the lower the resistance value will be; the colder the thermistor gets, the bigger the resistance will be. So at e.g. 20°C bed temperature the resistance will be ~125k Ohm, at 30°C it'll be ~81k Ohm.<br> There are general data sheets for this kind of thermistor to find with list the different resistance values at given temperatures. However, these values can slightly vary, depending on the manufacturer and the type of the 100k thermistor (e.g.: EPCOS vs. ATC 104 vs. General 3950). </p> </details> <details class=tip> <summary>Execute PID Tuning For The Bed</summary> <p>To make sure the heating algorithm can work as expected and keeps the fluctuation of the temperature as low as possible, execute a PID tuning for the bed. You can find information about how to do that in the section <a href=../../calibration/#pid-tuning>"PID Tuning"</a>. </p> </details> <hr> <h3 id=mod-insulating-the-bedplate>MOD: Insulating The Bedplate<a class=headerlink href=#mod-insulating-the-bedplate title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3> <p>What I personally can highly recommend is to insulate the underside of the bed.<br> You can get special insulation mats for 3d printers which meet the requirements for this (like being suited for higher temperatures and being flame retardant) for a few bucks. See the expandable textblock below for some tips about the installation. <br> Make sure you order the correct size (preferrably a bit bigger) which is 230x230mm as that's the size of the bedplate itself. </p> <p>The following picture shows an insulated bedplate. </p> <p><img alt="Bed insulated" src=../../assets/images/bed_K2Pro_insulation_complete_web.jpg></p> <p>By insulating the bed the temperature won't fluctuate as much as before, it heats up faster and it takes less energy to keep the desired temperature (so you actually lower the power consumption). It also takes longer for the bed to cool down which became impressively clear after doing a PID tune for the bed and comparing the graphs of before and after adding the insulation as the following screenshots will show.<br> The first screenshot shows the bed temperature (blue graph) before the insulation while doing a PID tuning. The temperature is set to 60°C, after reaching that temperature the bed cools down to 55°C and heats up to 60°C again (and so on). The second screenshot shows the same process but with installed insulation. You can clearly see that it takes longer to cool down after reaching the 60°C as the blue graph of the second screenshot isn't declining as steep and fast to the 55°C target temperature as the one in the first screenshot.<br> <img alt="Bed PID before insulating" src=../../assets/images/bed_pre-insulation_PID.jpg> <br> <img alt="Bed PID after insulating" src=../../assets/images/bed_post-insulation_PID.jpg> </p> <p>After adding the insulation, the temperature didn't fluctuate anymore at all during a print, even when I opened the window from time to time - the graph was just a straight line. So I'm actually highly satisfied with this and can strongly recommend insulating the bedplate.<br> However, I have to mention that I didn't print with higher bed temperatures than 60-70°C yet, so I don't know how good the insulation will stay in place when printing with bedtemps like ~100°, but I hope it'll still work out fine.. </p> <div class="admonition warning"> <p class=admonition-title>Mind The Gap!</p> <p>When adding insulation, it's extremely important to keep an eye on the clearing underneath the bed!<br> You don't want to risk the insulation hitting the bracket of the y-axis motor mount, so pay attention to that! </p> </div> <details class=example> <summary>Adding The Insulation</summary> <p>Before I'll go into the steps about how to apply the insulation, I have to point out a few things first: </p> <ul> <li><em>You'll need longer spacers and screws due to the thickness of the insulation (which is about 9-10mm most of the time)!</em> </li> <li><em>You'll need to raise the whole bedplate to avoid contact between the insulation and the motor mount at the back of the construction.</em><br> If you use the beforementioned 25mm springs and longer screws, you should be fine as they are longer then the stock spacers anyway.<br> If you'll use the stock spacers or silicone spacers of about the same size, you can add bolt nuts underneath to raise the bed. However, it's advisable though to get yourself longer spacers then! </li> <li> <p><em>It's also advisable to have Kapton tape on hand to cover the whole underside of the bedplate with it (before you actually apply the insulation) and to secure the edges and sides of the insulation (after applying the insulation)!</em><br> Make sure that <em>no bubbles</em> are trapped between the Kapton tape and the surface of the bed's underside then! And do a proper cleaning of the surface to avoid that the tape will (partially) come off! </p> </li> <li> <p>For adding the insulation, you need to dismount the bedplate from the gantry by taking out the four screws (remove the PEI coated plate first tho). Be careful with the wires when moving the plate. Also dismount the acceleration sensor and carefully move it out of the bed's underside you want to insulate. Put the plate onto the insulation (but don't peel off the protective layer of the adhesive yet!), align it and mark the four holes of the screws. </p> </li> <li>Then place the bed upside down on a flat and clean surface - wipe the surface beforehand tho to make sure that there's no dirt or even metal chips which would press into or stick onto the magnetic surface. Now use IPA or (which I prefer) silicone remover to wipe the underside of the bed where the insulation should be applied to and clean off any dirt or grease from your fingers. </li> <li>Now lay down the insulation onto the bed like if you would apply it (<em>but still with the protective layer on the adhesive!</em>) and adjust the position. Mark the area where the wires are connected to the bed as well and cut away that part of the insulation.<br> <img alt="Cut section" src=../../assets/images/bed_insulation_cutout_web.jpg> </li> <li>Place the spacers above the premarked holes and cut away the insulation in that area as well, so that the spacers will touch the plate later without any insulation between. I'd recommend to mark the areas that should be cut and then take the insulation away from the bedplate, so that you don't harm the surface when using a sharp knife or so. </li> <li>When it comes down to finally apply the insulation, <em>I personally would suggest to cover the whole surface of the bed with Kapton tape first,</em> just in case you'd have to tear off the insulation in the future. I also added two layers of Kapton tape especially above the contacts and the little piece of foam of the thermistor in the center of the bed and marked that area roughly at the insulation, just in case I'd have to replace the thermistor in the future.<br> <em>Make sure there are no bubbles trapped underneath the Kapton tape though!</em> <br> <img alt="Adding Kapton" src=../../assets/images/bed_K2Pro_insulation_kapton-partial_web.jpg> | <img alt="Adding Kapton" src=../../assets/images/bed_K2Pro_insulation_kapton-full_web.jpg> <br> Note: Looking back, I now would <em>remove</em> that piece of foam which covers the thermistor in the middle to make sure the insulation covers the bed without any air trapped in between! Cover that hole of the thermistor with Kapton tape though before you apply the insulation. </li> <li><em>Pay attention to add a sufficient electronical insulation underneath the area of the accelaration sensor. Since the cover of the bed's insulation is made from aluminum and the pins at the back ofthe accelerometer's PCB aren't protected, you could create a shortcut if they get in touch!</em> <br> <img alt="Electronic insulation" src=../../assets/images/bed_K2Pro_insulation_accel-sensor_web.jpg> </li> <li>Once everything is done and prepared, you can finally apply the insulation. Make sure you start at one side to avoid any bubbles, you want the insulation to stick on the bed equally. If some of the insulation protrudes beyond the plate, cut it off. The following picture shows the applied insulation. <br> <img alt="Bed insulated" src=../../assets/images/bed_K2Pro_insulation_complete_web.jpg> </li> <li><em>I highly recommend to additionally secure the insulation by using some pieces of Kapton tape as well to ensure that the edges and sides of the insulation won't come loose.</em> Don't skip this step, as the insulation most likely will come off sooner or later at the sides and edges (at least mine did). </li> <li>Then add the spacers and the screws and mount the bed onto the gantry again. Make sure that the insulation doesn't touch the construction and the motor mount at the back, the bed has to move as free as before. So move the bedplate manually to see if everything is fine and if there's enough clearance between the insulation and the other parts. </li> <li>If you used adjustable spacers, tram the bed again. </li> <li>When switching on the printer, make sure you proceed with executing an ABL procedure, adjusting the z-offset due to the raised bed and execute a PID tuning of the bed now and save the new values to the EEPROM. </li> </ul> </details> <hr> <h2 id=magnetic-foil>Magnetic Foil<a class=headerlink href=#magnetic-foil title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2> <p>On top of the aluminum bedplate there's a magnetic foil applied. If you order a spare part heat bed, then you'll most likely only get the aluminum bedplate, but not the magnetic foil. So you'll have to get yourself a magnetic foil as well.<br> If you choose a foil from the aftermarket, make sure to get the correct size. The bedplate is 230x230mm, but actually most of the foils being available on the market seem to be 235x235mm. That's fine though, as you can easily cut off any pieces of foil which are exceeding the dimensions of the bedplate then. Make sure to get yourself a foil which uses 3M glue. </p> <p>The following picture shows a magnetic foil that Anycubic shipped together with a replacement bedplate - the pictures show the parts of a different machine's bed (Kobra Neo), but the foil itself is pretty much the same though (the holes are just shaped slightly different plus there are two additional holes for mounting the z-offset sensor housing). </p> <table> <thead> <tr> <th>Magnetic Foil (Spare Part)</th> <th>Backside</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td><img alt="Magnetic foil" src=../../assets/images/bed_magnetic-foil_web.jpeg></td> <td><img alt="Magnetic foil underside" src=../../assets/images/bed_magnetic-foil-underside_web.jpeg></td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <details class=example> <summary>Attaching The Magnetic Foil</summary> <p>If you have to attach the magnetic foil onto a new or even your old bedplate, make sure to rigourously clean the bedplate before applying it.<br> If you use a new bedplate, peel off the protective film.<br> If you use your old bedplate, clean off any rest of old glue (if it's hard to get the glue off, you can use some e.g. WD40 to soften it and rub it off with a paper towel). </p> <p>Use IPA to wipe off any oil or grease which already gets on the the bedplate by just touching it. Silicone remover spray actually works even better. You can also use car break cleaner for this, but it leaves minerals on the plate, so better use silicone remover or wipe off the bed with IPA after using the car break cleaner. </p> <p>To make sure that everything <em>really</em> is clean, I'd suggest to wear disposable gloves, use paper towels and do more than one cleaning routine. Also make sure that no dust or anything else is left on the plate when attempting to attach the magnetic foil then. </p> <p>When applying the magnetic foil, peel off about an inch of the protective film of the glued side of the foil and position the foil along one of the edges of the bedplate.<br> <em>Avoid touching the glued side!</em><br> Make sure to position the foil correctly at the first attempt as you don't want to put yourself in the position where you have to pull off the foil again. Bend the foil a bit and then wipe along that stripe you already put on the bed from the middle to the outer edges with slight pressure. Pay attention to get the foil onto the bed smooth and even - there shouldn't be any bubbles of trapped air or even 'wrinkles' of the foil!<br> If everything worked out well for that first stripe, slowly pull off the protective film while applying the foil onto the bedplate in the described way. Means, go slowly in small increments and always apply pressure by wiping from the center to the sides for avoiding trapped air. </p> <p>Once you're done, wipe from the center of the bedplate to the sides once again while applying a bit of more pressure. Then heat up the bed to about 40-50°C (so that it's still safe for you to touch it without burning yourself) and let it sit for about 5min like that. Then wipe over it once again while applying pressure to make sure the foil is properly attached. Pay special attention to the egdes and long corners and make sure the foil really is attached well there. </p> <p>If you bought a 235x235mm or even bigger foil, cut off the protruding parts by using a scalpel or sharp knife. </p> </details> <hr> <h2 id=pei-plate>PEI Plate<a class=headerlink href=#pei-plate title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2> <p>The bed uses a removable 230x230mm PEI-coated spring steel plate which makes it easy to remove the printed object. </p> <p><img alt="PEI plate" src=../../assets/images/bed_K2Pro_PEI-plate_web.jpg> </p> <p>The plate that comes with the printer is textured on one side. <br> The following picture shows the surface of the textured side which you're supposed to print on from a close-up view. </p> <p><img alt="Close-up view of the PEI-coated plate" src=../../assets/images/bed_K2Pro_PEI-plate_closeup_web.jpg> </p> <div class="admonition warning"> <p class=admonition-title>Attention: PEI Plate Size</p> <p>If you're looking for a bedplate, a magnetic foil or just a PEI plate from a third party company, you need to get yourself a <em>230x230mm</em> plate, otherwise it would be too small!<br> As it seems that most parts out there are either 220x220mm or 235x235mm, get yourself the 235x235mm version then.

Let it cool down completely and try to peel it off. If that doesn't work well (depends on the materiall you were using), heat up the bed and try to peel off the filament then. If that also doesn't work, take off the plate and heat up the area using your hot air gun - sooner or later you'll be able to peel it off. However, be careful to not overheat and maybe harm the coating though. </li> </ul> <p><em>If you cleaned the bed properly, got your z-offset dialed in and use the correct bed temperature for the type of filament you're using, there's</em> <strong><em>no need to mess around with gluesticks, hairspray, blue tape or whatever!</em></strong> <em>The PEI plate really does work great!</em></p> <div class="admonition warning"> <p class=admonition-title>Don't Use Acetone For Cleaning The PEI Plate</p> <p>Some people seem to be using Acetone on a regular basis for cleaning the PEI plate - this isn't advisable as Acetone does harm the PEI coating.<br> It won't completely destroy it <em>immediately</em>, but it will harm it when being applied more often. Acetone seems to somehow 'attack' the PEI coating and makes it soft in the first place, like it dissolves it.<br> However, I heard from people who had serious problems with new PEI plates to get prints to stick on them even after thorough cleaning.

This is only due to the assumption that the springs that are needed for the following mod might add some instability to the bedplate, which could negatively effect the outcome when printing at the maximum speeds of 500mm/s and 20.00mm/s² acceleration Anycubic is advertising for this machine.* </p> </div> <p>I did a bit of tinkering and modded the bedmount to a 3 point bed mount instead of the classic 4 point mount. </p> <p>The reason for that is simple, but let me explain it a bit.<br> When I started with 3d printing and noticed how the bedplates are mounted to the gantry using 4 mounting points, I was actually a bit irritated. I got even more irritated after I discovered that this seems to be a common method at bedslingers, even when they offer manual bed tramming like at an Ender 3 for example.<br> Afaik, the best method to tram a rigid and flat surface is by using three points with two points being located along one axis (let's say the y-axis) and the third point being located perpendicular to that axis (so this is the x-axis in this example) at the (opposite) side in the middle of those two points: <br> - One of those two points located along the same axis is then used as the reference - you mount the plate there and never touch it again.<br> - The second point at this axis is then used for adjusting the tilt along this axis (in this example along the y-axis), it's called "pitch".<br> - The third point at the (opposite) side which is located in 'between' those first two mounting points is then used to adjust the tilt along that axis being perpendicular towards the first one (so in this example along the x-axis). This point is referred to as "roll". So when attempting to tram/level that surface then, you only have to adjust the pitch first and then adjust the roll. By doing so, you (should) end up with a perfectly trammed/leveled surface.</p> <p>So seeing all those bedslingers having the bed mounted to the gantry using four mounting points, one in each corner, I actually got really confused and started doubting and thinking about what I've learned in the past before I started to get my hands on a 3d printer.<br> Maybe it was a 4 point mounting because of the bed being heated up? Maybe it was because the plate was pretty thin? But then the effect of heating it up and tramming it by tightening 4 screws in a somewhat 'pattern' must result in a weird warped surface withe the effect and outcome would be pretty much unpredictable!?<br> So I did a bit of a research and thankfully discovered an <a href=https://drmrehorst.blogspot.com/2017/07/3-point-print-bed-leveling-vs-4-point.html>article where exactly this circumstance is being described and explained</a> for 3d printers. <em>I highly recommend reading it!</em> </p> <p>So, long story short: I decided trying to mod my printer's gantry and bedmount to a 3 point system. <br> To keep this section 'short', please see the expandable textbox below for the further description. </p> <details class=experiment> <summary>3 Point Bed Mount Mod</summary> <p>I gathered through my workshop and found an aluminum pofile which seemed to be useful for this attempt. I cut two pieces and drilled the belonging holes (the distance was about 164mm and I used a 5mm drill which gave me a bit of a play while installing it): one at each end for mounting the profiles to the bedplate and the gantry using the existing holes and threads, and one in the exact middle for the screw which then would be my 'roll' mounting point. The holes in the middle had to have a bit of an offset to each other as I used L-shaped aluminum profiles for better stability, so that the profiles won't hit each other when lowering the bed. </p> <p><img alt="Aluminum parts" src=../../assets/images/bed_3pt-parts_web.jpg> </p> <p>After mounting a screw to the middle of the part which will be attached to the bedplate, I then mounted the parts to the bedgantry and the bed itself.<br> As I have insulation added to the bedplate, I had to use bushings/spacers so that the insulation won't be compressed at the two mounting holes. I used some slightly too short spacers here first, which immediately lead to a bent bedplate due to the insulation pushing against the bed, especially in the middle section. After swapping out those spacers and using longer ones, everything worked out fine.<br> Of course I didn't found screws with the perfect length, but as I didn't want to drive t o the hardware store just for two screws and I didn't want to cut the original screws, I ended up using those. I also drilled the existing holes in the bedplate a tiny bit bigger for allowing a bit of movement which should take care of the expanding material while heating up. <br> After adding a spring to that screw in the middle, I then mounted everything together. </p> <p><img alt="Construction sideview right" src=../../assets/images/bed_3pt-right-sideview_web.jpg></p> <p><img alt="Construction sideview left" src=../../assets/images/bed_3pt-left-sideview_web.jpg></p> <p><img alt="Construction frontview closeup" src=../../assets/images/bed_3pt-frontview_web.jpg></p> <p>This is how it looks like in total from the front. I took the picture with the construction being untrammed to show the tilt (which will be adjusted by the 'roll' then) of the right side better. </p> <p><img alt="Construction frontview full" src=../../assets/images/bed_frontview-complete_tilted_web.jpg></p> <p>Right now I still have to take off the PEI plate (or at least lift the left front corner) for accessing and adjusting the screw for the pitch (because that one is still screwed into the thread of the gantry) which I chose the front left screw should be (the back left screw is my reference), the screw for the roll (which is now the screw in the middle at the right side) I can access from underneath the bed though which makes it easy to adjust. I'll probably end up changing the setup for the screw of the pitch as well. </p> <p>I then continued with a rough tramming without the PEI plate being applied, adjusting only the 'pitch' and then the 'roll' after having the 'reference' set to the desired height.<br> After that, I put on the pEI plate and excetuted the probing for a bedmesh (7x7 grid using Klipper) with the bed being cold - the result looked promising. </p> <p><img alt="Bedmesh 3point cold" src=../../assets/images/bedmesh_3pt_cold_web.jpg></p> <p>Then I heated up the bed and <em>immediately</em> did a new bedmesh - and I was actually kinda shocked, as I've never seen a heavily warped bed like that before. The promising thing though was, that the warp was somewhat consistent - it looked like a wave instead of a crooked pillow like before when being mounted at the 4 points. </p> <p><img alt="Bedmesh 3point just heated up" src=../../assets/images/bedmesh_3pt_just-heated-up_web.jpg></p> <p>I then let it settle for about 10-15min before executing another probing sequence. </p> <p><img alt="Bedmesh 3point settled" src=../../assets/images/bedmesh_3pt_settled_web.jpg></p> <p>As you can see, there is still some room for finetuning, like lowering the front by adjusting the pitch and adding some Kapton tape to certain spots as well for getting the bed as flat as possible overall, but as I was too lazy at that point and had stuff to print, I didn't do it then. </p> <p>Conclusion: so, will I do this mod at my other Neos as well and can I recommend it?<br> Yes, absolutely.<br> I might try to get a gantry from the aftermarket which already offers the option for this kind of 3 point mounting system and which is (hopefully) more rigid overall though, as the whole gantry itself really appears pretty flimsy to me. I'm not sure about that yet though, as I like to tinker and modify it with spending the less money I can - but if I'll end up buying such a gantry, I'll add pictures here and let you know how it went. </p> </details> <hr> <h2 id=anycubic-leviq-20-automatic-bed-leveling-function>Anycubic LeviQ 2.0 - Automatic Bed 'Leveling' Function<a class=headerlink href=#anycubic-leviq-20-automatic-bed-leveling-function title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2> <p>The printer comes with an automatic 25 point bed 'leveling' function called "Anycubic LeviQ 2.0".<br> This function measures the distance of the inductive <a href=../printhead/#abl-sensor>ABL sensor</a> to the PEI plate in a 5x5 grid, therefore at 25 points.<br> The data will then be used to compensate any deviations in the distance of the surface to the nozzle during printing by moving the printhead up and down along the z-axis. </p> <div class="admonition warning"> <p class=admonition-title>Clarification: What ABL Does And What It Does NOT</p> <p>To make this clear: <strong>don't get misleaded by the term "automatic bed leveling" - the process does <em>not</em> level or tram your bed automagically!</strong><br> It only measures and recognizes the distance towards the sensor at the 25 spots where it measures!<br> You can <strong>not</strong> level/tram the bed itself without tinkering, as it's mounted directly to the bed gantry with rigid spacers/bushings! </p> </div> <details class=info> <summary>Limitations Of The ABL Functionality</summary> <p>However, there are some limitations to this.<br> First of all, this compensation while printing isn't 100% precise due to the 5x5 grid (even though the data is interpolated).<br> Next, this compensation is somewhat limited by the amount of deviation and (imho) by the printing speed as well.

When it comes to executing the ABL function of the printer, it's advisable to initially check if the ABL sensor is leveled correctly to get the best results out of the ABL process. You can find information about how to do it for your specific model in the section ["ABL Sensor"](printhead.md#abl-sensor).     
--> <!--
To make the measured values of the ABL come into account later when it comes down to printing, you should add a certain g-code command to the start g-code section of your slicer. Even though this shouldn't be necessary as we have the belonging definement in the firmware (`#define ENABLE_LEVELING_AFTER_G28`), it seems to be advisable to do so.  
So: enter the settings in your slicer and search the place where this section is located. Then add the command `M420 S1` in a new line *after* the last `G28` command (which is the homing command) being in there. This will load the specific mesh values from the printer's EEPROM and activate the function of the ABL, so that minor height variations of the bed's surface will be compensated while printing.

We (try) to get the machine and certain parts of it aligned perfectly, like axes and parts being square, parallel, perpendicular and equidistant <em>towards each other</em>.<br> For example, we try to set up the frame being mounted perfectly square, the z-axis frame being perpendicular to the base frame, the x-axis gantry being perpendicular to the z-axis frame and the bed being parallel and equidistant to the x-axis gantry and the printhead/nozzle.<br> It's a technical term which is also used at CNC machines for example and this is the correct nomenclature. And as a matter of fact, this is also the case with 3d printers. Point. </p> <p>"Leveling" though is the process of bringing something like a shelf, a table or a framed picture hanging at the wall into the position that it's <em>perpendicular to gravity</em> so to say. Most of the time you do so by taking a bubble level or a self-leveling laser. <em>But this is NOT how you 'level' the bed of your 3d printer for example!</em> </p> <p>Yes, I'm highly aware of the fact that the majority of the 3d printing community uses the term 'leveling', that people say "Level your bed!" and that the marketing guys and gals of the companies use the (even more misleading!) term "Automatic Bed Leveling" (which is even worse as it suggests that the process will actually 'level' the bed itself - which it obviously doesn't). But that doesn't mean that I have to follow that misleading road. <br> So besides the fact that this isn't the correct nomenclature (seriously, I'm not the grammar police - I'm a German guy who speaks a little bit of English..), my 'problem' with this term is that it's just really misleading! </p> <p>How many beginners are pulling out their bubble level, put it on the bed or the x-axis gantry to check if it's leveled and maybe even shim out the table the printer stands on - just to come to the conclusion that their bed or gantry is leveled?<br> Believe it or not: many - whether you came across those users while trying to help them or not. You can use a 3d printer on a tilted table - if the printer is trammed, it'll still print fine. </p> <p><em>So to all those haters out there: yes, I will continue to use the correct term "tramming", no matter how much you'll attack and try to insult me.</em><br> And no, I don't do it because I want to show the world that I know the correct term, I do it because I want to avoid that beginners become frustrated because they just get it wrong.<br> And if you haters would start to actually do the same, then maybe one day there might occur a shift in the 'consciousness' of the community and the correct term would be used on a regular basis. Seriously, try to <em>help</em> people out by just using the correct term for making them realize that it's <em>not</em> about how perpendicular the bed or gantry is towards gravity - and stop harrassing people who already do so. </p> </details> <p>Even though "tramming" the bed isn't really possible when using the rigid stock spacers of the bedplate these printers come with, there is something one can and should do though: check if those spacers are all of the same height. <em>This is really important, so better don't skip this step!</em> </p> <p>If you're using <a href=#mod-adjustable-spacers>adjustable spacers</a>, then you'll be able to actually tram the bed itself. </p> <p>If necessary, you can add Kapton tape on the magnetic surface of the bed underneath the PEI plate later to equalize warped or dented areas as much as possible. If you do so, make sure to check if the z-offset sensor still has the perfect height position! </p> <p>I'll describe the belonging tramming process for each case in the following. </p> <details class=example> <summary>"Tramming" When Using The Rigid Stock Spacers</summary> <p>When using the rigid stock spacers the printer came with, dismount the bedplate from the bedgantry and take out those four silver metal spacers. Then put them next to each other on a flat surface and/or measure them using a caliper. They <em>might</em> not be all of the same height, which will lead to a somewhat crooked, tilted or 'warped' bed. </p> <p>Now you could either look for other spacers you might be using, put washers or other suitable material (e.g. gasket material) of the needed thickness under them when remounting or (what I'd recommend to do) <em>sand them down to the smallest of the four spacers for achieving an equal height</em>.<br> When doing so, put the sandpaper on a flat surface and carefully rub the spacers across it - <em>pay attention that you do this while holding the spacer absolutely perpendicular! You don't want to end up with a spacer where one end is sanded off tilted!</em> </p> <p>Once you're done and all four spacers are of equal height, reassemble everything. Then proceed with <a href=../axes/#tramming-the-x-axis-gantry>tramming the x-axis gantry</a> in relation to the bed. </p> </details> <details class=example> <summary>Tramming When Using Adjustable Spacers</summary> <p>You could also use <a href=#mod-adjustable-spacers>adjustable spacers</a> like silicone spacers or springs instead of those rigid spacers. That'll put you in the position of really being able to tram the bed.<br> However, if doing so you not only need to be precise when tramming the bed, but you should <em>proceed with <a href=../axes/#tramming-the-x-axis-gantry>tramming the x-axis gantry</a> in relation to the frame first</em>. This is really important as it will ensure that the x-axis gantry is parallel to the base frame.<br> Once this step is done, you can proceed with tramming the bed itself. </p> <p>When you want to tram the bed by adjusting the tension of the springs or silicone spacers to pull down a side or an edge of the bed, be careful to not bend the bed itself by tightening up just one corner too much. Try to push down one side of the bed and adjust two screws at a time. <br> I personally tram the bed by adding just a little bit of load to the spacers, so that the bed doesn't wobble. </p> <p>For actually tramming the bed now, you'll have to move the printhead to all of the four corners and adjust the height of the belonging edge of the bed by tightening or loosening the belonging screw. I'd suppose to start with the left backhand corner and rotate clockwise.<br> Take off the PEI plate and place an object onto the edge of the bed. It doesn't matter if this object is like 5mm or 5cm high as you're not setting the z-offset yet. It's just being used to ensure that the bedplate will be at the same height in relation to the printhead at all four corners. You need to make sure that you'll still be able to access the screw form the top though, so don't place the object right above the screw.<br> Then lower the printhead manually until the nozzle or the ABL sensor just touches that object. Then move the object to the next corner and move the printhead across it. Make sure that you absolutely <em>don't</em> move the head along the z-axis by accident, so that you don't somehow change the height of it!<br> If the head is positioned too low and there isn't enough space to fit the object between the bed and the head, tighten the screw for lowering the bedplate. If there's too much space, loosen the screw a bit until the nozzle/ABL sensor touches the object again.<br> Proceed with the other corners like that. Once you're done with all four corners, do another round and check if everything still fits. Most likely it won't as it affects the other edges when adjusting the height of one edge. When you're done with this round as well, put on the PEI plate, move the lead screw manually for raising the head and place the object in the first corner again. Lower the head and check all four edges once again if everything is correct. <br> When you're done, make sure the screws won't turn themselves loose due to the vibration, so add e.g. an additional lock nut as well. </p> </details> <hr> <h2 id=probable-issue-broken-wiring>Probable Issue: Broken Wiring<a class=headerlink href=#probable-issue-broken-wiring title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2> <p>There's a probable (upcoming) issue which is worth getting it's own section: breaking wires of the bed's wiring.<br> There are (besides the wiring for the aceleration sensor and the z-offset sensor) two types of wires at the bed: the thin ones which are the wires for the bed's thermistor and the thicker ones which are the wires for supplying the 24V DC to the coil at the underside of the bed for heating up the bed.<br> Due to repetive motion and the design, these wires might start to break over time.<br> To be more precise: the thin strands of the wires inside of the insulation start to break. Therefore the resistance of those wires will increase until the point is reached that all of the strands are broken and there's no contact given anymore. </p> <p>This breaking of the wires is a common issue at the Kobra Go and Neo, but here at the Kobra 2 Pro it seems that Anycubic used slightly longer wires. So hopefully this will not be such a common issue, but I'll go a bit into detail here anyway, just in case this problem occurs. </p> <p>In the beginning you'll most likely notice this when you have an error message appearing which tells you that the bedtemp is abnormal (I didn't come across the specific error message yet, so I can't tell you right now how exactly the message will be).<br> Even though you can fix this issue by replacing the wires of the thermistor as described in the next sections, sooner or later this will also happen with the thicker wires. And even though this can be fixed as well by replacing the wires, it's not as easy 'detectable' as with the wring of the thermistor, as there won't be an error message if strands of the 24V wires start to break and therefore the resistance becomes bigger.<br> Unfortunately this breaking of the 24V wires is a potential risk of a fire hazard though, as the wire will heat up at that particular spot where it starts to break - due to the increasing resistance and the higher current running through these wires compared to the wires of the thermistor. The more the wires break and the higher the resistance will become here, the hotter the wire will become as well - until the insulation might melt and (worst case) the whole wire starts catching fire. </p> <p>So, besides keeping an eye on that during the regular maintenance you're doing, there <em>might</em> be something you could do to minimize the risk of premature breaking wires. Read the expandable textbox to see what I did to hopefully minimize the risk. </p> <p>If you have to replace the wirings, I'd suggest to use slightly longer (and thicker) high-flex wires, as that'll allow a slightly bigger range of motion, assuming that it'll have a positive effect on the overall bending as well. In that case you might also think about routing the wires differently.<br> Some people add wire chains, and even though it seems to be a good idea in general, you should pay attention to the bending radius of the chain as well as to the size of the chain itself. You don't want to squish the wires in there and you don't want to make them rub against each other or against the chain too much as well. </p> <p>See the following sections for how to fix this problem. </p> <hr> <h3 id=mod-wiring-harness-support>MOD: Wiring Harness Support<a class=headerlink href=#mod-wiring-harness-support title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3> <p>The problem of breaking wires here is caused by the wires being too short in the first place, causing the effect that the wires will bend right behind that black plastic cap.<br> So the first and best solution would be to either extend the existing wires or e.g. add an <a href=../powersupply/#add-an-external-mosfet-mod>external MOSFET</a> to the back of the printer's frame which then indirectly elongates the wiring as well. </p> <p>However, even then the wires are prone to still start bending right behind the black plastic cap as well, even though the bending won't be as much 'hard' with longer wires than it would originally be. </p> <p>To minimize this effect, I experimented with different solutions. The main goal for me here was to extend the bending area. As cablechains are having/causing different issues, I didn't go with those but experimented with some solutions you can easily make up yourself.<br> I don't have <em>that</em> one and only final solution right now as I'm still experimenting with different mods at my Neos for testing what might be the best here.<br> However, right now three simple 'hacks' seem to work - at least a bit, as I didn't run into the problem of broken wires here yet (..knock on wood..).<br> To keep this section as short as possible, I'll go over each of them in an expandable textbox as usual. </p> <details class=example> <summary>Duct-Tape</summary> <p>The first 'hack' is to actually just wrap some layers of duct tape around the plastic cap and the first inch or two of the wiring.<br> By doing so, you'll stiffen up the wires a bit in that first section right behind the cap, avoiding the punctual bending. You need to make sure that the whole construction won't be too stiff as it should still be able to bend overall though, otherwise you'll provoke the same issue right after the attached tape.<br> As I'm using my printers in an enclosure, this solution didn't last long though. The heat inside the enclosure made the glue of the tape warm and it lost contact to the black plastic cap. So I personally can't recommend this one. </p> </details> <details class=example> <summary>Self-Sealing/Welding Tape</summary> <p>The second 'hack' is actually kind of the same like the duct tape method, but instead of wrapping the self-sealing tape around the outside of the plastic cap, you wrap it around the wires.<br> I forgot to take a picture of it, but it's fairly simple, so let me explain it a bit.<br> - You cut the cabletie which holds the wire inside that plastic cap and take the whole wire harness thing out.<br> - Then you wrap self-sealing tape around it, also in the area which will be inside of that cap later. So I'd say cover an area of about 2-3 inches with several layers, while applying more layers in the front part (towards that soldered contacts).<br> Make sure the wire is still able to easily bend in that area, you don't want to have it too stiff which would just lead to the circumstance that the sharp bending would occur right behind the taped area. - Now fiddle that wire back into place at the plastic cap like it was before and secure the position with a new cabletie.<br> - That's it :) </p> <p>For the sake of simplicity, I'd recommend this solution as it's easy to apply, even with the stock setup.<br> If you don't know or have self-sealing / self-welding tape yet, give it a try. It's really great and comes in handy in several cases. </p> </details> <details class=example> <summary>Self-Sealing/Welding Tape And A Silicone Tube</summary> <p>The third option I tried is actually kind of similar to the one being previously mentioned, but instead of only using self-sealing tape, I used a piece of silicone tube in addition. <br> - First, I cut the cabletie which holds the whole wire 'package' to the black plastic cap.<br> - Then I took a piece silicone tubing which I cut at one side and placed it across that specific section of the wire.<br> - I then wrapped self-welding/sealing tape across it and secured everything again with a cabletie.<br> You can see this 'hack' at the following picture. <br> <img alt="Wiring harness" src=../../assets/images/bed_K2Pro_wiring-harness_web.jpg> </p> <p>I have to admit though that I probably exxagerated it as the additional silicone tube made it quite stiff. So if you want to go with this solution, keep an eye on the thickness and stiffness of the tube as well as how many layers of tape you apply. </p> </details> <details class=example> <summary>Spring And Heat Shrink Tubings</summary> <p>The last method I'd like to mention is the one using a semi-stiff spring and some heat shrink tubings. </p> <ul> <li>Disconnect the wires and pull the whole wiring harness through a semi-stiff spring as shown in the following picture.<br> <img alt="Step 1" src=../../assets/images/bed_wires-springmod1_web.jpg> </li> <li>Then pull the wiring harness through a heat shrink tube which then goes in between the wires and the spring to avoid that the spring rubs on the wires and harms the insulation.<br> <img alt=Protection src=../../assets/images/bed_wires-springmod3_web.jpg></li> <li>Place the spring with the wires in the plastic cap and add a cabletie to hold it in place.<br> <img alt="Step 2" src=../../assets/images/bed_wires-springmod2_web.jpg></li> <li>Now pull the wires through a bigger heat shrink tube and place that one across the end of the spring and the wires that come out of it, to secure everything here. By doing so, you'll reduce the motion of the wires in the spring itself and stabilize the wire a bit. When the wires will be pulled/moved, they won't be bent at the spot right after the spring and won't be moved around in the spring as well.<br> The following picture shows the final asssembly.<br> <img alt=Final src=../../assets/images/bed_wires-springmod4_web.jpg> </li> </ul> <p>This is actually my preferred solution, BUT: you have to pay attention to use a spring which isn't too stiff! I had one laying around in my drawers at my workshop, so I can't give you any further specs. Best would be to check at a hardware shop and bend the spring to make sure it bends easily. You don't want to stiffen it up too much, you just want it to act as a guide for when the wires are being bent. </p> </details> <hr> <h2 id=checking-and-fixing-the-electric-circuit-and-the-thermistor>Checking And Fixing The Electric Circuit And The Thermistor<a class=headerlink href=#checking-and-fixing-the-electric-circuit-and-the-thermistor title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2> <p>If problems occur with the electric circuit or the thermistor, you can check each of them for localizing the cause of the error.<br> You'll need a <a href=../../tools/#multimeter>multimeter</a> for doing so.<br> Basic knowledge of how to use a multimeter is sufficient - if you don't know how to use a multimeter, please do a web research.

If your multimeter doesn't have this function, you can measure the resistance instead. </p> <p>However, <em>it's advisable to measure the resistance, even though your multimeter offers the function of probing for continuity,</em> because it might be the case that a wire still passes the check for continuity, but that individual strands of the wire are broken. This causes problems if those strands lose contact permanently or during movement of the bed, as it leads to a higher resistance. </p> <ul> <li>At the 24V wires this can lead to the circumstance that the wire will get hot at that spot, that the insulation will melt, that a shortcut might occur and it might even occur that it causes a fire. </li> <li>At the thermistor wires this can cause the <a href=../../troubleshooting/#err-mintempmaxtempthermal-runaway>ERR: MINTEMP</a> error message. When the problem of breaking strands starts to occur, you'll experience the upcoming of this error message when the bed is moving and reaches a certain position. In that case those broken strands lose contact, which leads to a suddenly changing resistance value. As the temperature is interpreted by the reisistance value of the bed's thermistor, a suddenly changing resistance is interpreted as a sudden change in the temperature. If this change is 'big' enough, the belonging error message will be triggered. </li> </ul> <p><strong>Procedure:</strong> </p> <ul> <li>Unplug the belonging connector and check the belonging wire(s) by probing at the beginning and the end of the wire. So place one probe of the multimeter at the connector and the other probe at the solder joint of the wire you want to check. </li> <li>If continuity is given and/or no or a <em>very</em> small resistance (it should be <em>really</em> close to zero resistance though!) is measured, start bending the wire slowly and pay attention to the measured resistance. Take a few iterations when doing so, bend the wire in different radii, at different speed, at different spots. If at one point the resistance suddenly changes, the problematic and broken part of the wire is detected. </li> </ul> </details> <details class=example> <summary>Measuring / Checking The Thermistor</summary> <p>You can check if a thermistor is working or if it's broken by measuring the resistance of it using a multimeter. As described above, at a temperature of 25°C the resistance should be ~100k Ohm (nominal restistance: R<sup>25°C</sup> = 100 kΩ ± 1%). If the temperature is lower, the resistance value will be higher; if the temperature is higher, the resistance value will be lower.<br> The following table gives you some typical resistance values of a 100K thermistor type 3950 (generic) for temperatures around room temperature. The values might slightly vary from the one you'll get, but they should be pretty close. </p> <table> <thead> <tr> <th align=center>Temperature in °C</th> <th align=center>Resistance in kΩ (kilo Ohm)</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td align=center>15°</td> <td align=center>~157 kΩ</td> </tr> <tr> <td align=center>20°</td> <td align=center>~125 kΩ</td> </tr> <tr> <td align=center><strong>25°</strong></td> <td align=center><strong>~100 kΩ</strong></td> </tr> <tr> <td align=center>30°</td> <td align=center>~81 kΩ</td> </tr> <tr> <td align=center>35°</td> <td align=center>~65 kΩ</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p><em>Set your multimeter to resistance testing for a higher Ohm range - in most cases the multimeters have different settings, usually 200/2000/20K/200K/20M -&gt; use the setting "200K" here.</em> </p> <p>You can measure by probing the belonging wires at the plug of the mainboard (unplug it!), that would be the white connector labeled as "T1" with the green and blue wire (see the chapter <a href=../mainboard/#trigorilla-v_306-stock>"Mainboard" -&gt; "TriGorilla V_3.0.6 (Stock)"</a> for a picture of the location). </p> <ul> <li>Keep in mind though that by probing at the connector, you also measure the wiring itself, which would be needed if you want to check if you maybe have a broken wiring. Means, if there are e.g. broken wires, the thermistor won't work even if the thermistor itself is still fine. </li> <li>If you don't want to check the wiring, you could measure at the soldering joints right at the bed - in this case you also check the conductor path of the PCB itself (keep in mind that some glue across the solder pad area might prevent a successful measurement, so make sure you really make contact to the solder joints!). </li> <li>If you really want to <em>only</em> measure the thermistor itself (which is advisable if you're in doubt and are thinking about changing the thermistor), then you'd have to pull off the little foamy piece in the middle of the underside of the bed and measure the resistance right at the soldering joints or legs of the thermistor itself. </li> </ul> </details> <details class=example> <summary>Checking The 24V Heating Circuit Of The PCB</summary> <p>You can also check the 24V heating circuit of the PCB itself, like when the bed doesn't heat up (in this case make sure to also measure if 24V are coming from the belonging screw terminal for the heated bed at the mainboard!). <br> Besides inspecting it closely if any visible damages like scratches or abraded spots are visible, measure the continuity and resistance of the 24V circuit as well. </p> <p><em>Then set your multimeter to resistance testing for a low Ohm range (in most cases the multimeters have different settings, usually 200/2000/20K/200K/20M -&gt; use the setting "200" here).</em> </p> <p>For checking the 24V heating circuit, disconnect the wires from the mainboard's screw terminal.<br> Then probe at the ends of the wires (which connect to the screw terminals) - by doing so, you also check the wiring as well.<br> Double-check and probe at the solder joints right at the bed as well (keep in mind that some glue across the solder pad area might prevent a successful measurement, so make sure you really make contact to the solder joints!). </p> <p>If the circuit is ok, continuity will be given and a resistance of about <strong>3.2 Ω</strong> should be reported. </p> </details> <hr> <h3 id=how-to-fix>How To Fix<a class=headerlink href=#how-to-fix title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3> <p>If you encounter a <strong>faulty thermistor of the bed</strong>, you can replace it with a new one.
