Means, check the whole z-axis lead screw system for being assembled correctly and vertically aligned and that the timing belt is properly tensioned.   Make sure the lead screws are lubed, that the anti-backlash nuts are installed correctly, that the coupler between the motorshaft and the lead screw is tight, that the pulleys are mounted tightly and so on.   At the x- and y-axes, make sure that you have all wheels positioned correctly (neither too tight nor too loose), that you don't have bad bearings which cause hiccups and irregular movements and that the belts aren't sloppy or too tight.   So the best would be to go through the chapter \"Axes\" and check all mentioned parts step by step.  </li> <li>Check if everything moves smoothly while the printer is switched off!   Means, slowly move the bed and the printhead manually across the whole range of motion and turn the lead screw by hand (across the whole range of motion as well) and check if you feel any unusual resistance in certain areas. Alter the movement speeds then and see if everything still feels well.    Parts being attached to the axes and running along them like the printhead and the bed shouldn't wiggle as well.   When everything looks and feels good, you can move the bed, the printhead and the position of the x-axis gantry to about the middle of the range of motion, then turn on the printer and home all axes using the control unit to see if the endstops are working.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"calibration/#tram-the-bed","title":"Tram The Bed","text":"<p>Even though tramming the bed (aka 'leveling' the bed) isn't really possible when using the rigid stock spacers of the bedplate these printers come with, there is something one can and should do though: check if those spacers are all of the same height.  </p> <p>See the section \"Tramming The Bed\" for further information and instructions about how to do so.  </p>"},{"location":"calibration/#check-the-z-axis-and-the-timing-belt","title":"Check The Z-Axis And The Timing Belt","text":"<p>Checking and tramming the whole z-axis lead screw system for being vertically aligned is crucial.

And even then it might occur that you'll have to adjust certain settings later when finally printing 'real' models. So maybe try to see it more like a process instead of the struggle of a search for the 'perfect' settings which must be out there somewhere..  </p> <p>Also keep in mind that you'll have to do certain calibrations again when using different kinds of filament. This doesn't only comes into account when printing a differenty type like ABS or PETG instead of PLA, but it also most likely will be the case when using the same type of filament but made from another manufaturer. Even the same type and brand of filament from the same manufacturer might need some slightly different settings like the temperature for example, when you're using a new spool or a different colour.  </p>"},{"location":"calibration/#z-offset","title":"Z-Offset","text":"<p>The z-offset is the distance between the nozzle and the bed/plate you're printing on. It comes into account when printing the first layer of a model and therefore it's crucial and absolutely important that you dial in your z-offset to get your first layer as perfect as possible. If the nozzle is too far up above the plate, you'll experience that the print doesn't stay onto the bed or (if it's way too far up) that it'll just produce 'spaghetti' while printing up in the air. If it's too close to the plate and therefore the filament will be squished into the plate too much, then it'll either be difficult to remove the object or (if the nozzle is way too close) it'll provoke clogging as the filament won't be able to come out of the nozzle. Worst case would be that the nozzle scrapes across the plate and that you damage the hardware itself.  </p> <p>Even though the z-offset will be somewhat calculated by the printer itself by probing the z-offset switch, you might need to finetune the setting on the fly while printing an inital layer of a model. The perfect z-offset can also change when using different types of filament, means, you might have to adjust it when using e.g. PETG instead of PLA.  </p> <p>To determine the perfect first layer, I'd recommend to have a look at this handy guide from Billie Ruben first to get an impression how you can judge if the first layer (and therefore the z-offset) is good or not and how it should look like. </p> <p>After initiating the probing and calibration sequence using the control unit, start a print job and verify that the first layer came out perfect. Compare the look of it with the abovementioned poster from Billie Ruben to check if it really is perfect or if you need a bit of adjustment. If you need to adjust the height, you don't need to execute an ABL sequence again, just correct the z-offset setting. You can also adjust it 'on the fly' using the control unit while printing a (larger) first layer and look at the outcome - this is often even better as you'll see the effect right away.    </p> Don't Rely On The \"Paper Method\" <p>Using the abovementioned feeler gauge or a sheet of paper (which people usually recommend - using a feeler gauge is more precise though) for dialing in your z-offset is only an approach to get in the right area of your z-offset. The optimal z-offset for printing a perfect first layer depends on various factors like e.g. layer height and type of filament being used. So always check the first layer while printing it and dial in your z-offset on the fly while printing it.   </p> Print A Skirt <p>I personally recommend adding a skirt to the models you're printing. You activate that setting in your slicer, there you can also determine the width of the skirt and the distance to the model. When printing a skirt you print a few lines outside the area the model will be printed. This serves as a purge line (I personally don't use a purge line because I use a skirt) and you can check if the z-offset is set correctly. If not, you can adjust in on the fly. You could also add a brim in addition to a skirt or even instead of a skirt - a brim is connected to the model though (which helps keeping the model stuck on the bed) which isn't always wanted.   </p>"},{"location":"calibration/#printing-temperature-filament","title":"Printing Temperature (Filament)","text":"<p>You determie the best printing temperature for your specific type of filament by printing temperature towers. These models change the printing temperature at certain layer heights in certain steps (e.g. in 5\u00b0C increments, starting with the highest temperature first), so that you'll print the same structure with different temperatures. For generating a temperature tower with your own specific settings, I recommend using the abovementioned SuperSlicer with the inbuilt calibration toolset. You can take the recommendations of the manufacturer of your filament as a rough guide for the temperature range you should print at.   </p> <p>Then you inspect the printed model: in which temperature zones does it look best? Where are the layers of the filament solidified and melted together best? Where do overhangs look best and where does (massive) oozing and stringing occur?  Don't pay too much attention on stringing and oozing yet though, as you'll take care of that later by printing retraction towers. Same goes for bridges (and overhangs): if you notice that bridges didn't come out perfect and that you can see strings of filament 'hanging' down, don't get too irritated by that as well. You can and should take care of bridging specific settings in your slicer later anyway, like a different printing speed, different extrusion rate, different fan speed and so on.    </p> <p>What's actually more important at this time right now is the bonding of the layers! You can encounter an already pretty much great looking print with lower temperatures, but the model will break apart between layers easily. Vice versa you can observe that some stringing, oozing and/or maybe some poorer bridging quality will occur at higher temperatures, but the bonding is much better! As you'll take care of settings that affect stringing and bridging later anyway, I'd recommend to always go with the higher temperature when in doubt!  Besides only looking at the outcome, I personally use to tear apart the printed temperature towers. By doing so, you can find the best printing temperature - not only in terms of the 'look', but also in terms of mechanical stress and resistance. So try to break each temperature section apart by using your hands first. You'll most likely already encounter some floors which are easy to break apart. Once you're done with that, take two pliers and repeat the process for each floor. You'll most likely be able to break every floor at a certain point, but you'll notice some obvious differences like how much force you have to use and how the floors break apart. So after you teared the model apart, inspect those areas: did it clearly break right between two layers? Or did it break across different layers? When it clearly broke between two layers, inspect the next floor with the higher temperature being used. Try to find the floor where it seems that the layers sticked together very well and the break most likely occured across different layers.    </p> <p>Once you're done and decided to go with a specific temperature, continue with other calibrations like printing retraction towers, calibrating the e-steps and so on. At the end I'd recommend to print another temperature tower once again for being able to compare the output to the first one you printed. You don't have to print such a 'large' and wide ranged temperature tower though, maybe just print a tower with the 'final' settings and temperature you decided to use and add a floor with 5\u00b0 higher and 5\u00b0 lower temperature.   </p>"},{"location":"calibration/#retraction-settings","title":"Retraction Settings","text":"<p>As a crucial element for great printing results you need to find the optimum settings for retraction distance and retraction speed. Both settings have to be evaluated for each filament you're using. You'll note that the settings may differ not only within the same type of material, but especially within different types of material (when printing PLA for example you'll end up with pretty different settings than you'll use when printing flexible TPU). In general you'll determine the correct settings (after determining the correct print temperature) by printing retraction distance and retraction speed towers. Slight adjustments might be necessary later on though, so pay attention to not only the stringing, but also to e.g. starts and ends of layers where over-/underextrusion might be occur due to imperfect retraction settings.   </p> <p>The correct settings will mostly avoid stringing. There are various aspects which affect stringing though, so if you struggle with stringing, you might want to have a look at the section \"Stringing\" where I list some factors that affect it. </p> <p>Feeder Gear Pressure Is Crucial!</p> <p>It should be noted that the correct pressure of the feeder gear is very crucial (not only) when it comes down to retracting. If the feeder gear pressure is too low, the gear won't 'grab' the filament sufficiently and therefore starts slipping and grinding instead of pulling it back. If the pressure is too high though, it'll deform the filament which may result in e.g. visible artefacts of your printed model. So make sure you adjusted the correct pressure.  You can check if the filament gets properly fed and retracted by looking at the filament while printing. Adding some marks with a water resistant pen might be helpful. Observe the filament if it gets retracted (= pushed back) and fed reliably when the printer should do so.   </p>"},{"location":"calibration/#retraction-distance","title":"Retraction Distance","text":"<p>The retraction distance is a crucial setting one has to take care about. The retraction distance is the setting how far the feeder gear will pull back the filament when retracting.      </p> <p>Finding the correct retraction distance setting can be difficult and might take a few iterations, as it depends on various other settings and variables, so there isn't a general one-fits-all setting one could use.  </p> <p>As this is a direct drive system, you need to go with small retraction distance settings. Due to the Volcano-like nozzle and the longer melting zone, you can try up to 2mm and still should be safe (imho). Start with the smallest settings though!</p> <p>For finding out the correct retraction distance setting, you can print retraction distance towers, where different retraction distance values are applied at certain heights (kinda the same like when printing temperature towers). Before doing so, you should have figured out the correct printing temperature though.   </p>"},{"location":"calibration/#retraction-speed","title":"Retraction Speed","text":"<p>Retraction speed is the setting how fast the feeder gear will pull back the filament when retracting. It plays together with the setting of the retraction distance, and both settings affect each other. In general it seems that you can say that the higher the speed, the lower the distance can be - but like with every 'rule of thumb', this is just a 'rough' guide and you'll need to find out the optimum setting for your specific setup by your own. You might also find out that things work out much better and that you get better results when using a lower retraction speed.    </p> <p>It has to be mentioned though that a high(er) retraction speed isn't always the key - it can also be the case that using a lower speed is necessary for getting the best results. This also depends on the type and quality of the filament as well.  </p>"},{"location":"calibration/#calibrating-e-steps","title":"Calibrating E-Steps","text":"<p>You've probably already came along the sentence \"calibrate your e-steps\" and maybe you wonder what it is, what you'd have to do and why you should do so. It's actually pretty simple: the \"e-steps\" are the steps of the motor of your extruder (so \"e-steps\" stands for \"extruder-steps\") and therefore they determine how much filament will be extruded with a certain amount of motor steps. Depending on how accurate this setting is (means, how well you calibrated the e-steps), you'll either have some pretty perfect prints (in the meaning of the amount of filament of each layer) or you'll see signs of more or less severe under- or overextrusion. Now some people try to adjust or get rid of this problem by setting different extrusion multipliers in the slicer without touching this setting, but that's not the best/correct way (imho), as you always should have the hardware tuned in as much as possible before trying to tweak software settings for better results.  However, due to the fact that KobraOS is based on Klipper where you'd have to change the e-steps (which are called rotation distance in Klipper) in the file <code>printer.cfg</code> and that we don't have access to this file as KobraOS is closed-source, we can't actually adjust the setting. So one has to go with adjusting the flowrate in the slicer.</p>"},{"location":"calibration/#pid-tuning","title":"PID Tuning","text":"<p>Without going into too much details here, PID stands for Proportion, Integral and Derivate. These are three variables of an algorith which is supposed to keep the temperature stable. By executing a PID tuning, the printer heats up the desired heating element (extruder or bed) to a given temperature, cools down again a few degrees and heats up again for a given amount of circles and measures the fluctuation. After the process is done, you'll then get an output of three values P, I and D and save them to the firmware.  </p> <p>It's advisable to execute a PID tuning for both the extruder and the bed before you want to use your printer for the first time. Also after you changed something at the hotend (like installed a new nozzle or heatbreak) and especially if you changed the cartridge heater or a thermistor (or even the position of it when removing and reinserting it) or installed a new bed, you should execute a PID tuning.  </p> <p>Again, as this KobraOS is based on Klipper, one would usually do that with two specific commands for the hotend and the heated bed - but as there's no way to connect to the machine locally through a webinterface like Mainsail or Fluidd (as there's no Moonraker API implementation given here), we can't execute PID tunings this way.   </p> <p>As I didn't check yet if the control unit offers this function, I can't give you further information right now if this calibration process can actually be initialized.

I won't go into detail about e.g. how to position the v-slot wheels or how to change parts at the hotend, as you'll find notes and instructions about that in the belonging sections about the parts.  </p> <p>Generally speaking, this list is just some sort of a rough guideance you can follow where to keep an eye on. Due to the fact that parts are moving, vibrances occur and heat is being generated, parts will wear and tear and components may fail sooner or later. So it's advisable to keep an eye on the whole construction as well as on specific parts especially to avoid any malfunction as much as possible.  </p> <p>The more you're using the printer, the more often and regular you should actually proceed these checks. Sooner or later it'll become a routine for you, so don't be overwhelmed by the following list.  </p> <p>If you're using the machine not that often, you still should pay attention. In this case keep an extra eye on the v-slot wheels and their position and condition, as it may happen that they'll become indented due to resting in the same position over a longer time. You should be able to feel any dents when moving the wheels, but you probably have to be a bit sensitive for being able to tell that.</p> <p>This is still WIP, so maybe come back another time as well.. ;)</p> Don't Use WD-40 For Lubrication <p>Do yourself a favour and never use WD-40 for lubrication as it's not a lubricant! It's perfectly fine for e.g. washing off old lubrification from the threaded rod, but it's not a sufficient lubrification like e.g. \"Super Lube\"!  </p> <p>People use to think WD-40 is the perfect solution for pretty much everything, but they aren't aware of the fact that -due to the chemical recipe it's made of- it's absolutely not sufficient for getting parts lubed mid- to longterm. Fact is, that the chemicals inside of it will even wash off any grease or oil, it can harm POM and rubber and so on.  </p> <p>As an example: So let's say you want to lubricate your bike chain and use WD-40 to do so, you'll basically wash away the existent lubrification  which is inside the chain - therefore the chain will be worn out pretty quick. You'll also harm the sealings. If you don't believe me, make a little test by yourself: take an air baloon, pump it up, spray WD-40 onto it and wait..  </p>"},{"location":"maintenance/#frame","title":"Frame","text":"<p>Check if all screws, bolts and nuts are still tight as they should be.

Means, you can't e.g. set up a host which is running OctoPrint or Pronterface and use it to access or monitor the printer. However, I'm still hoping that someone will sooner or later come up with a workaround for that. If not, then you might reach the point that you want to use a different mainboard for being able to connect to the machine and also run native Klipper on it as shown here. So, even though you can't connect to a local host/printserver with the stock mainboard yet, I still list some hardware below which can be used as a printserver - just in case.. ;) </p> <p>Sooner or later you'll come to the point that you want to use additional software like OctoPrint to control your printer.

The RPi is a little computer which became pretty famous since it entered the market. It's a Broadcom SoC 64bit ARM system with LAN (and WiFi within the newer versions) and a microSD card reader onboard which keeps the desired OS. It offers GPIOs to directly connect hardware like sensors to it and it draws only a little amount of power. Pretty much all of the regular software for 3D printing like the beforementioned OctoPrint or Mainsail or so are available as specific RPi image which makes it pretty easy and flawless to install even if you're not an expert. Just install the Raspberry Pi Imager, create the specific image, copy it to a sufficient microSD card and you're good to go - the installation will take a few minutes only. And as handy as it is - it might not be the best solution, especially these days.  </p> <p>Prices for the RPi went up to a ridiculous level (afaik at least in Europe and the US) - if they're even available at all. Also you don't want to get yourself an old RPi2B for example, it should be a RPi3B at least (referring to OctoPrint a RPi Zero 2W also works, it uses the same Broadcom SoC like the RPi3) - a RPi4 would be even better and advisable. Not only because of the pure processor power or the RAM - both is sufficient even with the RPi3 for example, but mostly because of the reason how the USB sockets are connected to the CPU. Afaik, up until the RPi3 the Broadcom BCM2837 only offers one USB port itself. This one port is split up by using a SMSC LAN9514 hub chip to get four USB connectors out of it and it also uses the LAN port.  </p> <p>If you're asking yourself now \"What the heck is this guy talking about - I have four USB connectors available there, so what's the problem?\" - well, let me try to explain it to you very simple: Imagine you connect your RPi3 to a monitor and plug in a mouse, keyboard, your 3D printer and a webcam to the USB sockets and maybe you also use the LAN connection (because everybody who knows wireless uses wires ;) ). Then you start your printing process sending the gcode file to the printer and start to observe the printing process using the camera. Then all of the information are running across the same one and only USB port of the SoC (the main CPU). That means that most likely you'll find yourself noticing some kind of stuttering during the printing process and/or the stream of the webcam. That doesn't occur because of a lack of RAM or CPU power (what people use to assume) - that occurs because of the architecture and the bottleneck \"one USB port at the SoC\". So you can see it like a four lane street going down to one lane - as soon as there's (much) traffic on all of those four lanes, you'll get stuck in the traffic where it goes down to one lane.  </p> <p>So does that mean you shouldn't use a RPi? No, not at all, it works absolutely fine - just be aware of the fact that it might not be the best solution for your money during these times where they became pretty expensive.  </p> Looking For A Raspberry Pi? <p>If you're trying to find a RPi and have a hard time finding a company who actually has one in stock, maybe give the page rpilocator a try. It lists vendors and different RPi models and shows if there are RPis in stock.   </p> RPi Plus Touchscreen <p>If you're using a RPi, you can add a touchscreen to it and install an additional software like OctoDash which gives you a nice clean UI for OctoPrint optimized for small screens. It allows you to display certain status information and makes it possible to interact with OctoPrint directly using the touchscreen. Especially when you're using the Klipper firmware instead of the stock firmware, this is a great solution to still be able to monitor and control your printer while you're sitting in front of it as the regular control unit of your printer doesn't work with Klipper anymore.

You don't need 4K to see what's going on and by using a low resolution you can at least decrease the amount of information that has to run through the mentioned bottleneck.  </li> <li>Don't create a time lapse video as it really is consuming a lot of processor power and RAM.</li> <li>Get rid of the USB cam and set up an IP cam (WiFi/LAN) instead which isn't connected to the RPi. Up to me this is even a better solution then downgrading the webcam as the RPi doesn't have to deal with the data from the IP cam at all. If you like to tinker and don't mind the probable effort, get yourself one of those cheap ESP32-CAM modules and set it up. Or just go for a cheap WiFi/LAN camera.   </li> <li>If you're already using a RPi\u00be with a RPi cam and don't have a sufficient housing for that yet, have a look at the thing from A_Leh: Anycubic Vyper/ Kobra Raspberry 4b (+3b) housing with camera attachment</li> <li>Last but not least: make sure you're using a good and fast microSD card and a good USB cable which connects the RPi to the printer.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"printserver/#rpi-zero-2-w","title":"RPi Zero (2) W","text":"<p>Instead of using the regular Raspberry Pi, you could also get yourself the RPi Zero (2) W.

It might not really come into account if your prints last only a few hours and after finishing them you turn everything off. But as soon as you think about running those machines pretty much 24/7 you should keep in mind that they might draw a lot of power which sums up at the end.

Ok, might be a bit exxagerated, but I really love those fellas. Especially if you want a host for running Klipper on, Thin Clients are my number one recommendation.</p> <p>If you've never heard of them, let me give you a quick introduction: Thin Clients are computers which are often used by companies for e.g. setting up workstations for their employees or to have some kind of information desk or screen running somewhere. They have a small build factor, don't draw an excessive amount of power and usually come with connectors for LAN, USB, a monitor and so on. Especially newer models (like only a few years old) have hardware built in which would be even powerful enough to replace your daily driver for surfing the web, watching videos, writing stuff and so on. Generally speaking: the newer and bigger they are, the more they have to offer usually - I'm talking about energy efficient quadcore CPUs here and the possibility to put in up to 32GB or even 64GB of RAM, swapping in a SSD (2.5\", m2.SATA or m2.NVMe - that often depends on the age actually) and even run virtual machines (tip: ProxmoxVE) or containers (tip: Docker). Of course you could also just install a LinuxOS like Ubuntu or a headless Ubuntu Server and install your desired software directly there.  </p> <p>The (imho great) point is: you can get a pretty powerful and energy efficient machine which is a true x86 platform for just a little amount of money as companies use to sell them pretty cheap most of the time. You probably have to look out for a certain model a bit longer sometimes as they use to be sold out quite fast, but it would be worth it. Anyway - even if they're usually available for a fair price, I want to mention that it's advisable to not buy the very first offer you can find. Even though they're still cheap most of the times compared to a RPi4 for example, certain companies know about the potential and that people like to use them for tinkering around, so some companies call for much higher prices than others.  </p> Tips About Thin Clients <ul> <li>There are many different Thin Clients from different manufacturers available out there - a good site I'd like to recommend to gather around and check out the specs of different Thin Clients is ParkyTowers.  </li> <li>If you're looking for something really small, maybe look out for a Dell Wyse 3040 or 3020. They do have limited power and RAM possibilities compared to bigger Thin Clients, but for just acting as a headless print server instead of a RPi they're powerful enough.   </li> <li>I personally like the HP Thin Client T6x0 series as you can upgrade them really well. The higer the number, the newer the model and the more powerful, energy efficient and compatible with modern parts it is (e.g. T610 uses a 2.5\" SSD &amp; DDR3 SO-DIMM RAM while the T630 uses a m2.SATA SSD &amp; DDR4 SO-DIMM RAM).    </li> </ul>"},{"location":"printserver/#nas-server","title":"NAS / Server","text":"<p>If you have a NAS or a server up and running already, you could also install the printing software onto that.

One of those sources of information I'd like to mention though is the video of Thomas Sanladerer: How to run OctoPrint on your phone! and the GitHub repository of feelfreelinux: octo4a.  </p> <p>Besides the possibilty to use your old android device as a printserver, you can also use it as an additional screen for software like OctoPrint. That means that you don't install e.g. OctoPrint itself on the android device - you install an app which connects with the running instance of OctoPrint and gives you a nice UI on your smartphone. By doing so you could mount your old phone at the printer and interact with OctoPrint using your touchscreen or just have certain information displayed at the screen.  </p> <p>However, it should be mentioned here that it seems to be a bit like gambling to find the right device which connects with the USB chip being used at the printers mainboard and that can be charged parallel to being connected to the printer as well. It might even occur that the mainboard might get affected somehow if one applies 5V to it through the USB-C connector. </p> KlipperScreen On An Old Android Device <p>Especially when you flashed the Klipper firmware onto your mainboard, using an old Android device as an additional screen mounted to the printer is a cheap solution for still being able to execute direct commands or having status information visible while sitting in front of your printer as the regular control unit doesn't work with the Klipper firmware anymore. Just install KlipperScreen and you're good to go.  </p> USB OTG <ul> <li>I'd like to mention one of the probably biggest issues you might encouter: charging the device while having it connected to the printer at the same time.  While it shouldn't be a problem if you're having a device with a separate power plug or wireless charging, it might become a problem if you'd have to use some kind of solution which splits up the line for USB charging and OTG - not all devices work with that.  Additionally, I personally would be concerned about probably harming the printers mainboard due to a faulty cable or whatever. </li> <li>What also should be mentioned here as a warning is the fact that devices which are connected 24/7 to the charger might be a huge hazard as the battery could catch fire or even blow up.

Of course a more powerful hardware can also handle a higher resolution though.

Depending on what you want to solder, you should choose the best option. Generally speaking, for small parts like thin wires, electronic components and so on, you want to use an iron with a lower wattage and a pointed tip. If you need to solder thick wires or bigger components, you most likely will choose a more powerful iron with probably a more flattened tip. Often both kinds of irons are sold in a set, like a more powerful 80W one with a wide and flat tip and a 40W iron with a pointed tip. If you don't have any soldering irons at all, you can go with one of those cheap sets.  I personally love my little 12W \"Weller Mini\" for tinkering, as it is thin and good to grab and parts don't tend to overheat quickly as it could happen when you use a 40W or 80W iron for example. There are well-priced soldering stations out there which allow you to adjust the power and the heat and which also offer a small hand piece, so I'd recommend you go for something like that.

If the nozzle is too close to the bed, the filament will get squished into the plate too much and that will (depending on how close the nozzle actually is) provoke clogging as well as it makes it difficult to remove the printed model later. The first layer is crucial for a perfect print, so take your time and get your z-offset dialed in well.    See the section \"Z-Offset\" for further tips and check out this handy reference as well for determining the perfect first layer.   First tip: check the underside of your print - if you can clearly see or even vaguely identify individual lines, your nozzle is still a bit too far away from the bed.  </li> <li>Of course you have to pay attention that you really cleaned the PEI plate of the bed properly using e.g. simple dishwasher soap (no balm or 'soft' soap as they often contain some oily ingredients) and IPA to make the prints stick to it.   I personally prefer and highly recommend silicone remover spray (that's the stuff the guys are using who are painting cars on a professional basis to get off any oil and grease off the chassis before starting the actual paintjob), it just works great. </li> <li>Avoid touching the plate with your bare hands and fingers as that'll leave a tiny amount of grease onto the plate as well.  </li> <li>Also make sure that you chose the correct temperature of the bed for the filament you're using. If the bed is either too cold or too hot, then the print won't reliably stick to it either.   For PLA for example it should be around 55\u00b0C - don't exceed 60\u00b0C for PLA as that's already the glass transition temperature of PLA (means, that's where the filament starts to get soft). For PETG I personally have to use 80\u00b0C.     </li> <li>Turn off the part cooling fan when printing the first (few) layer(s) and use the correct fanspeed depending on your filament (e.g.: PLA needs a lot of cooling, PETG needs usually less cooling).     </li> <li>Once the plate is clean, the z-offset is dialed in and the bedtemp is correct for the type of filament, the PEI plate really works great. There's no need to mess around with some sort of gluestick, tape, hairspray or whatsoever.  </li> <li>I'd also suppose to add a brim to your model (you need to do it in the slicer), which helps keeping the print staying on the plate a lot. This is especially useful for objects with a small base. You can configure the width of the brim in your slicer. After finishing the print, you just wait until the object is cooled down and then you can break/tear the brim off the object. If tiny amounts of the brim stay at the model, just use a sharp cutter.   </li> <li>You also should check the functionality and position of the z-offset 'sensor' which is being used by the machine to set the initial z-offset automatically while doing the calibration procedure. So read around that section and pay special attention to the section \"Adjusting The Sensor's Height\". You still have to observe the first layer while it's being printed though and you most likely still have to adjust the z-offset on the fly while printing the initial layer! </li> <li>Also make sure that you trammed the x-axis gantry, so that the nozzle has the same distance to the plate across the whole area. This might not be enough though if you're encountering a tilted bed along the y-axis, so check the next listing. </li> <li>Wiggle the bed and check if it moves in the vertical plane. If it does, check the bolts and nuts of the bedgantry and check the SG15 bearings for perfect position. Most likely the wheels (or at least one) are a bit too far away from the aluminum frame. Adjust the position of the wheels then, but pay attention to not adjust them too tight as well.  </li> </ul>"},{"location":"troubleshooting/#stringing","title":"Stringing","text":"<p>Stringing can be caused and affected by different factors and therefore can't always be avoided by adjusting retraction settings only. You can find countless articles about it, so maybe do a little research on it. Based on my own experiences, the following variables besides the retraction settings should be taken into account as well as one probably doesn't think about them in the first place:  </p> <ul> <li>The type of filament (PLA, ABS, PETG, TPU).  </li> <li>The quality of filament.  </li> <li>The moisture of filament: moist filament increases stringing.  </li> <li>The printing temperature: too high as well as too low printing temperatures cause stringing.  </li> <li>The feeder gear pressure: if it's too low, the gear can't grab the filament reliably and therefore can't retract reliably.  </li> <li>The state of the feeder gear: if the teeth of the feeder gear which grabs the filament is kinda clogged due to debris of the filament, then it might slip as well.   </li> <li>The quality and the state of the nozzle: low-quality nozzles as well as worn out and/or slightly clogged nozzles can increase stringing. Also the diameter of the nozzle has an impact as it determines how much filament gets extruded.   </li> <li>The quality and the state of the PTFE tube inside of the heatbreak.   As an example: stringing got way better after I replaced the stock PTFE tube with a Capricorn one, it seems that the lower friction of the Capricorn tube affected the retraction capability. Also a slightly clogged and/or deformed tip of the PTFE tube affected this a lot.  </li> <li>Retraction settings, so the retraction distance and the retraction speed.   Even though one would usually assume that higher values should/would be better to avoid or at least deal with stringing, it's not always the case. So instead of e.g. going higher than 1mm retraction distance at the direct drive of the Neo (which would provoke clogging), go much lower and see how it goes.   This seems to be affected not only by the type of filament (flexible filament like TPU needs completely different settings than pretty hard filament like PLA for example), but also by the quality of filament. Often cheap filament is lighter and more flexible than high quality filament and therefore it needs lower retraction settings overall to achieve good results.   </li> <li>The object one wants to print: certain objects just caused stringing, even tho I usually printed without any stringing. I'd recommend to print retraction towers with two cone-shaped towers as well, to get the different diameter into account as well.  </li> <li>The settings of the slicer, like wiping, z-hop, outer- vs. inner perimeter and so on. There are many articles and videos about this topic, so I'd recommend to do some research on it for your specific slicer.  </li> </ul>"},{"location":"troubleshooting/#holes-andor-bulges-in-layers","title":"Holes And/Or Bulges In Layers","text":"<p>These are mostly signs of under- / overextrusion and/or a clogged nozzle.  </p> <ul> <li>If you observe a regular pattern like a vertical line where these gaps and bulges occur, then it's most likely the z-seam. You could change the setting of your slicer for the z-seam to \"random\", but that'll lead to random artefacts all over the print. In that case you'll most likely also note these artefacts in other spots of your model where layers start or end.   As you can't use Linear Advance with the stock firmware, there isn't that much you can do about this under- and overextrusion an the beginning and the end of a layer besides making sure that you calibrated the e-steps correctly. You might be able to tweak some settings in your slicer though and optimize it a bit.    </li> <li>If you observe holes in layers, or even longer lines in layers where filament is missing, then it's most likely too much retraction distance and/or a (partial) clog you're dealing with (which also gets provoked by too much retraction distance btw).   So I'd recommend to check the retraction settings and clean the nozzle by e.g. doing some cold pulls. If the problem gets a bit better but persists, I'd recommend to disassemble the hotend, clean everything, inspect and maintain it and reassemble it again.

You can either get yourself one of those (imho overpriced) filament dryers or use a food dehydrator. If you don't have any of them, you can use the well-controlled solution we all already have: the heated bed! Just lay your spool flat onto the bed (maybe put it on some small wooden pieces or so to raise it up a bit) and cover it with e.g. a cardboard box where you poked in some small holes and which you also placed onto some small objects to raise it up a bit and create a small gap between the box and the bedplate for a better circulation. Then heat up the bed to the specific temp you need for drying the type of filament you want to dry.

One probably wouldn't notice a difference if using them side by side, but there is one huge difference: besides different <code>printer.cfg</code> settings, the KobraOS for the \"Trigorilla Spe B_v1.0.x\" seems to be the same as the one being used in the Kobra 3 - and for that one there is a modded KobraOS available.

Unscrew the two screws you can see at the blue plastic cap of the belt tensioner and carefully pull it off the frame. You might have to turn the knob even more counter-clockwise if it doesn't come off right away. Once you've pulled it off, you'll see the parts as shown in the picture below (right now the picture shows the disassembled y-axis tensioner, but besides a slightly different shaped plastic cap, the interior looks the same - I'll add a belonging picture of the x-axis tensioner soo though).  </p> <p></p> <p>If you have to replace certain parts, you can easily disassemble the pulley by pushing out that little shaft to one side, so that you'll have all the parts laying in front of you each by their own.  </p> <p> </p> <p>The following picture shows the 20 teeth pulley which is used in this assembly.  </p> <p> </p> Reassembling The Belt Tensioner <p>For reassembling, just put the pulley back into place and stick that little shaft back to where it belongs. Then route the belt through that bracket - make sure the belt isn't somehow twisted and that the teeth are gripping onto the pulley - the smooth side of the belt needs to face you when you look at it from above. Stick the setup back into the blue plastic cap and stick the screw of that knob into the belonging hole at the front. Turn the knob a few times clockwise to make the thread grip the bracket. Then slide the whole setup back into place where it belongs and screw in the two screws which hold the blue plastic cap into place. finally hook up the ends of the belt to those notches at the metal mounting plate of the printhead again.    Once everything is done, adjust the belt tension again by turning the knob clockwise.  </p>"},{"location":"hardware/axes/#belt-tension","title":"Belt Tension","text":"<p>It's kinda difficult to explain the correct belt tension, so you'd have to experiment a bit with that. Generally speaking, the belt shouldn't be too tightened up and shouldn't be too loose either. If it's too tight, too much pressure will be put onto the motor shaft which will do harm, the belt can snap etc. - if it's too loose though, the belt might even slip. Either state (too tensioned and too loose) can cause artifacts.   </p> <p>My 'rule of thumb' here is: if you can bend the belt down a bit by applying some pressure with your finger onto it but you still feel a good amount of resistance, then it's a good sign that you're in the right area of tension. So start from there and if you feel or need to do so, play around with different belt tensions while printing the same bject over and over again for finding the best tension for your setup.   </p> Some Notes On Belt Tension <p>People often recommend \"Tighten your belts!\", but that's actually not always the solution if artifacts like layer shifts occur. As a matter of fact, I made many different tests with my Neos and evaluated the different influences of factors like belt tension, wheel position, quality of ball bearings of the wheels, a trammed vs. untrammed frame/printer setup and so on. And to be honest: a belt being too loose in terms of being the cause for severe problems only occured when it was really that loose that even someone who has no experience at all with this would notice it. If a belt is sagging, I'd assume that a user would notice that and realizes that this can't be good.   </p> <p>Don't get me wrong - of course different tensions of the belts do have a certain influence of the quality of the print, and it might be worth to finetune the tension for getting the last little amount of perfection out of your print. And yes, of course, if a belt is too loose, then it can slip or it can cause layer shifts due to a slight 'lag' which occurs when the motors start to drive the belt or when a sudden change of the direction occurs. But: a belt being too tight can cause artifacts as well. Not only that - it can and actually will harm the hardware. Users reported not only snapped belts or harmed motors, one even reported a bent bracket where the motor of the Y-axis was mount to. So, believe me or not: even though there are people in forums and on YouTube who claim that a belt can't be too tight - it definitely can.  </p> <p>Using the abovementioned 'method' of roughly setting your belt tension to a 'medium' value, I found that other factors have a much bigger impact on the print quality and the reliability and well-functioning of the whole printer. Let me give you two short examples to show you what I mean:  </p> <ul> <li>If your wheels are too tight, of course you also need to increase the belt tension - but in that case it's not the belt tension what's causing the issue in the first place, it's the wrong position of the wheels.  </li> <li>If you have bad ball bearings at the wheels (which is actually most likely the case due to the cheap parts being used), then those may cause an irregular/inconsistent movement of the wheels and you can feel regular 'hiccups' while moving the belonging part (like the bedgantry or the printhead). You can feel how you have to apply more force at certain spots when moving the part manually by hand, as it feels like it's getting stuck at certain spots. So a belt being too loose isn't the cause of the problem here and therefore tightening up your belt isn't the solution - replacing the bad bearings with some quality ones is.  </li> </ul> <p>So, use your brain and don't always follow the typical answers like \"Tighten you belts!\" when you're experiencing issues like layer shifts for example. Instead, look at your printer more 'holistic' and see the different parts which are working together in the end. Pay attention to each of them, once again starting by inspecting the frame and making sure everything is still trammed and set up well here. Due to vibrations and repetitive motions screws can come loose, parts can and will wear out and therefore a frame or other parts you set up a while ago can and will come out of alignment by time.</p>"},{"location":"hardware/axes/#maintenance","title":"Maintenance","text":"<p>You should inspect the belts and the belonging parts like pulleys etc from time to time to make sure everything is in a good condition and nothing will suddenly break.  </p> <p>Belt</p> <ul> <li>Check the belt tension from time to time as it might wear out and lengthen a bit. </li> <li>Check the teeth of the belt if they are still good looking or if they're worn out or if even some teethe are missing.</li> <li>Check if you can see any cracks or other damage at the belt.</li> </ul> <p>Pulleys </p> <ul> <li>Check the pulleys of the motors which are driving the belts.

Of course the belt itself can be physically harmed as well when grinding across sharp edges or when it gets old, but you should notice that when examining the belt every now and then when doing the regular maintenace of your printer.  </p> <p>If you encounter a snapped belt, get yourself a good quality one as a replacement - don't go with the cheapest no-name product you can get. I'd suggest to look out for an original \"Gates Powergrip\u00ae\" belt. You can get them in different lengths, like one or five meters.

The motor is located at the left hand side of the x-axis gantry.  </p> <p> </p> Spare Part Motor <p>As there aren't any specifications and replacement motors from Anycubic being available, you can either use a motor with the beforementioned specs or get yourself a motor from a Creality Ender 3 (or one that's advertised to fit that printer).  </p> Attention When Connecting A 'Generic' Motor! <p>As the connections of the stock vs a generic or a 'Creality'-type motor are/might be different due to different pinouts of the coils, you need to make sure you connect it correctly! So, before connecting it to the mainboard though, take your multimeter and identify the coils by probing the pins of the motor's connector! Compare your findings with the ones from the stock motor - you might have to switch the position of certain wires inside of the plug.</p> Identifying The Coils And Connections <p>When you want to use a different motor than the stock ones, it's most likely the case that the coils are connected to different pins of the 6 pin connector of the motor. The best would be if you take a multimeter and probe the pins to see which ones belong to a coil. So let me go over this procedure really quick - don't worry, you can't harm the motor by doing the following.  </p> <p>Take your multimeter and set it either to continuity measurement or to resistance measurement. Either one will work - if you have the option for continuity measurements, choose that one though as they often offer a little buzzer which makes a sound when continuity is given.  </p> <p>Unplug the motor (of course) and hold one of the two probes of the multimeter to one of the pins of the 6 pin connector of the motor. I personally like to start at the left side, so hold one probe onto the very left pin. Then use the other probe and touch the other pins - one after another. Make sure that both tips of your probes really make contact to the desired pins. Once you found the corresponding pin for the very left sided pin you placed your first probe onto, mark that. Then move the probe to the next pin and repeat the process. In the end you'll come up with having two 'paired' pins identified - each pair belongs to one coil.  </p> <p>For illustration purposes, the following picture shows the coils of a motor from a Kobra Neo and a Creality motor.    </p> <p> </p> <p>If the pairing of your probed pins is the same - fine, you can connect the motor right away.  </p> <p>If the pairing is different, like at the Creality motor shown in the picture, you need to pull out two wires of the connector of the motor cable (one wire of one coil each!), switch them accordingly and insert them back in the connector housing. At the shown example with the stock vs. the Creality motor, you'd just switch the position of the two inner wires here.  </p> <p>You can pull out the wires (inclduing the attached metal contacts) by pressing down a tiny metal latch of that contact. Take something like a needle or a tiny screwdriver for that. Gently press that latch down and slightly pull on the wire - the wire with the contact being attached will come out. Once you put it into the correct position, just push it back into the belonging hole - but mind the orientation! You might hear a little \"click\" sound, but check if the wire really got into position by looking after that latch and by pulling at the wire - it shouldn't come out.  </p> <p>After a final check if everything is still ok, connect the motor - it should work now.  </p> <p>If it happens that the polarity of the coils/wiring is wrong, you'll experience a stuttering and probably noise-making motor.

So, in a summary: the SG15 bearings should touch the rail and sit on it well without any noticeable amount of play which would cause a wiggeling, but they should still be able to move smoothly. The following picture shows a bearing which is too far away from the rail, you can clearly see the huge gap between the rail and the grove of the bearing (circled in red).

We (try) to get the machine and certain parts of it aligned perfectly, like axes and parts being square, parallel, perpendicular and equidistant towards each other. For example, we try to set up the frame being mounted perfectly square, the z-axis frame being perpendicular to the base frame, the x-axis gantry being perpendicular to the z-axis frame and the bed being parallel and equidistant to the x-axis gantry and the printhead/nozzle. It's a technical term which is also used at CNC machines for example and this is the correct nomenclature. And as a matter of fact, this is also the case with 3d printers. Point.  </p> <p>\"Leveling\" though is the process of bringing something like a shelf, a table or a framed picture hanging at the wall into the position that it's perpendicular to gravity so to say. Most of the time you do so by taking a bubble level or a self-leveling laser. But this is NOT how you 'level' the bed of your 3d printer for example! </p> <p>Yes, I'm highly aware of the fact that the majority of the 3d printing community uses the term 'leveling', that people say \"Level your bed!\" and that the marketing guys and gals of the companies use the (even more misleading!) term \"Automatic Bed Leveling\" (which is even worse as it suggests that the process will actually 'level' the bed itself - which it obviously doesn't). But that doesn't mean that I have to follow that misleading road.  So besides the fact that this isn't the correct nomenclature (seriously, I'm not the grammar police - I'm a German guy who speaks a little bit of English..), my 'problem' with this term is that it's just really misleading!  </p> <p>How many beginners are pulling out their bubble level, put it on the bed or the x-axis gantry to check if it's leveled and maybe even shim out the table the printer stands on - just to come to the conclusion that their bed or gantry is leveled?

By doing so, you make sure that the bed and the gantry are parallel to each other and therefore the distance of the nozzle to the plate is pretty much the same all along the x-axis.  </p> <p>As the printer comes with rigid spacers (the cylindric metal pieces between the bedplate and the bed gantry), you aren't really able to \"tram\" the bed unless you replace the stock spacers with adjustable ones - which I personally won't suggest to do at this machine, regarding the high speed and accelerations this machine is running.   The problem with those rigid stock spacers is, that they might not be all of the same length/height - so I'd recommend to at least dismount them, check if they're all of the same height and if they aren't, sand them down to an equal height. By doing so you can at least make sure that you won't have a tilted or warped bed caused by spacers of different legth. See the section \"Tramming The Bed\" for further information and instructions.  Make sure to take care of this before actually starting to tram the x-axis gantry, as you'll tram it in relation to the bed. </p> <p>After taking care of the spacers (either the stock ones or after getting yourself new adjustable ones), reassemble everything. Now you can proceed tramming the x-axis gantry:  </p> <ul> <li>If you're using the rigid stock spacers, tram the gantry in relation to the bed itself.  </li> <li>If you're using adjustable spacers, tram the gantry in relation to the frame itself and then tram the bed in relation to the nozzle at different positions (see the section \"Tramming The Bed\" for further information and instructions about it).     </li> </ul> <p>Please see the expandable textbox below for further instructions about how to tram the x-axis gantry.  </p> Tramming The X-Axis Gantry And Adjusting The Wheels <p>When it comes down to tramming the x-axis gantry, up to me one should differ between tramming it in relation to the frame of the printer and in relation to the bed. Depending on which spacers are being used, you should either do the one or the other:  </p> <ol> <li> <p>Tram in relation to the bed, if you're using the stock spacers, because you can't really \"tram\" the bed itself. Make sure you checked the rigid stock spacers of the bedmount for an equal height before tramming the gantry though! If they're not all of the same height, I'd recommend to sand them down to the height of the shortest spacer.  </p> </li> <li> <p>If you've swapped the stock spacers and are using adjustable ones, like silicone spacers or springs, then you should tram in relation to the frame itself to make sure everything is square and perpendicular like it should be. Of course the whole frame has to be assembled correctly first, so make sure the base frame really is mounted square and the aluminum parts of the z-axis frame really are perpendicular to the base frame!    In this case follow the steps being mentioned in the following, but instead of placing two identical objects onto the bed, place them onto the base frame and rest the aluminum part of the x-axis gantry onto them. After bringing those y-shaped metal brackets into the correct position, make sure to retighten the screws while the aluminum frame of the x-axis is perpendicular to the aluminum frame of the z-axis at both sides.   After that, tram the bed itself to the x-axis gantry by adjusting the height of the bed by using the screws and adjust it at the four corners to the same distance of the nozzle (e.g. 0.1mm by using a feeler gauge or a sheet of paper).  </p> </li> </ol> <p>Note: the following description is for tramming the x-axis gantry in relation to the bed itself when using the rigid stock spacers! If you're using adjustable spacers, the procedure is pretty much the same, you just have to put two pieces of equal height onto the frame of the printer (where the z-axis aluminum frame is mounted onto) and rest the x-axis gantry onto them instead of placing those pieces on the bed itself! </p> <p>For being able to access the belonging parts and screws for the following tramming process, you need to turn the printer around so that you face the backside of it. I personally prefer to also take off the printhead for this procedure, just to not have it in the way, but you don't have to do it. </p> <p>The following description is about the process without taking out the lead screws completely. However, if you didn't take care of cleaning and lubing the lead screws yet as well as checking the whole z-axis lead screw system for perfect vertical alignment and the anti-backlash nuts for a correct installation, this is the perfect time to do so! </p> <p>Take your time for this! Read attentively, best would be to read this whole description before even attempting the actual tramming process. Follow the steps and be as precise as you can be! </p> <ul> <li> <p>In order to tram the x-axis gantry in relation to the bed, so that both are as parallel as possible, take two parts of equal height like cans for example and place them onto the left and right side of the bed.  </p> </li> <li> <p>Drive the x-gantry up/down until it's about 5mm lower that the cans. </p> </li> <li>Take out the two screws which attach the anti-backlash nuts to their respective mounting brackets at the x-gantry, so that you can move the x-gantry upwards without the anti-backlash nut being attached.   </li> <li>Loosen the grub/set screws of the pulleys at the top of the screws where the timing belt runs across.   By doing these two steps you achieve that there isn't any kind of force being added to any side of the gantry which will lead to a false result.   You want the gantry to rest on the cans only by it's own weight!  </li> <li>Now lift the gantry your hand and slide the two cans underneath it. Don't spin the lead screws to raise the gantry! </li> <li>Place the cans to the very left and right side of the bedplate.   Make sure to have the cans positioned as far to the sides of the bed as possible. Also make sure to push them backwards so that only the rod of the linear rail of the gantry touches them!    This is crucial - you don't want those y-shaped metal brackets touch the cans at all!  </li> <li>Now lower the gantry carefully until it rests on the cans with the rod of that linear rail at the underside of that aluminum rail of the gantry.  </li> <li>Check if the 'noses' of the anti-backlash nuts still sit in that notch of those y-shaped metal brackets how it should be while there's still a little gap between the upper side of them and the corresponding mounting brackets. See the following picture for a better understanding what I'm talking about.    If it's not the case and the nuts are either too low (so that those 'noses' aren't sitting in that notch) or too high (so that there isn't a gap between them and the mounting bracket), slowly turn the lead of that side accordingly until it looks like in the picture shown above.   </li> <li>Once you're done with that, pay close attention to the position of the gantry on those cans.   The following picture shows the slightly crooked gantry resting on one can (the left one), where there's a noticeable gap between it and the can on the right side. </li> <li> <p>Now loosen the two hexagon socket screws at each side of the aluminum frame of the gantry which are holding each of the Y-shaped metal plates (where the wheels are mounted onto, at the backside so to say) against it. Don't take them out (!), just loosen them a bit.   The following pictures show the locations of those screws.  |  </p> </li> <li> <p>The goal now is to bring these brackets into position so that the rail of this x-gantry completely rests on those cans like the following picture shows.    For achieving this, you now might have to wiggle and trun the brackets a bit to get everything aligned up well.  </p> </li> <li> <p>The following picture illustrates the following steps for achieving the perfect position of those Y-shaped brackets (yes, it's the Y-shaped metal bracket of the Kobra Neo, but the principle is absolutely the same).  Important note: with adjusting the position of the inner wheels by turning the eccentric nut (now and later as well), you only adjust the pressure and how tight the wheels sit and run along the z-axis frame. The position of the outer wheels only can be achieved by positioning them manually as described. </p> </li> <li> <p>With those brackets being loose, adjust their position by slightly wiggling and turning them until the outer wheels of them touch the aluminum frame of the z-axis. Do one bracket at each time.   Don't pay (too much) attention to the inner wheel yet though, as you'll adjust the position of it in the following step. Remember: right now you want to achieve that the bracket is in the position that both of the two outer wheels touch the aluminum frame!    Once you found that perfect position of that bracket, hold it in place with one hand, press down the rail of that x-gantry onto the cans once again for making sure it rests on both of them and then tighten the two bolts again to secure the brackets in it's position while still holding the bracket into position.   Do this for both sides.   Once done with this, make sure the x-gantry still rests on the cans equally.    </p> </li> <li> <p>Now adjust the position of the inner wheels by turning the eccentric nuts in the correct position. You want to achieve that all three wheels touch the frame. Make sure to not position those inner wheels too tight against that rail - it should sit good in that v-slot, but you don't want to tighten them up too much which would cause too much resistance and unnecessary wear and tear.   Do this for both sides.   The following picture shows an eccentric nut which I painted to make the special shape of it more visible.    As you hopefully can see, the bolt isn't centered - so if you turn that eccentric nut while being mounted, the position of the bolt and therefore the whole wheel will be changed, either towards or away from the v-slot of the rail it's sitting at. </p> </li> <li> <p>After you did this, pay attention to the rod of that linear rail of the x-axis gantry once again - you want it to rest completely equal on both cans as shown again in the following picture. </p> </li> <li> <p>Now all of the wheels should touch the aluminum frame of the z-axis and the x-axis gantry should be as parallel to the bed as possible. The y-shaped brackets should be at pretty much the same position as well.  </p> </li> <li> <p>Now that the brackets, wheels and the whole gantry is trammed perfectly, carefully turn each lead screw so that the anti-backlash nut is coming upwards again. Pay close attention as you only want to drive it up until the point that it just touches the bracket - you DON'T want to drive it any further which would lift up that specific side of the gantry!    Once they are in place, put the screws back in and mount the anti-backlash nuts back to their brackets.  </p> </li> <li> <p>Once done with that, check the position of the gantry once again. If everythings still looks fine and the rod of the linear rail still touches both cans equally, tighten up the grub/set screws of those pulleys at the top.  </p> </li> <li> <p>When everything is set up again, move the z-axis up and down by using the control unit. Again, everything should move smooth. Home the z-axis and you should be good to go!   </p> </li> </ul> <p>Congratulations, you just trammed the x-axis gantry! </p>"},{"location":"hardware/axes/#y-axis","title":"Y-Axis","text":"<p>The following picture shows the baseframe of the machine where you can see the y-axis very well.  </p> <p> </p> <p>The y-axis is the long rail in the middle which reaches from the front to the back and where the gantry of the bed (the gantry is the construction where the bed is mounted onto) is running along.  </p> <p>The gantry of the bed is belt driven (GT-2 type, 8mm wide), the motor which drives the belt is positioned at the back of the printer.  </p> <p>You can adjust the tension of the belt by using the knob at the front side of the aluminum profile where the bed is guided onto.

In that case turn the knob counter-clockwise until the belt completely sags. Then unhook one end of the belt from the bedgantry (I suggest to unhook it in the front of the bed gantry).

Once everything is done, adjust the belt tension again by turning the knob clockwise.  </p>"},{"location":"hardware/axes/#belt-tension_1","title":"Belt Tension","text":"<p>It's kinda difficult to explain the correct belt tension, so you'd have to experiment a bit with that. Generally speaking, the belt shouldn't be too tightened up and shouldn't be too loose either. If it's too tight, too much pressure will be put onto the motor shaft which will do physical harm, the belt can snap etc. - if it's too loose though, the belt might even slip. Either state (too tensioned and too loose) can cause artifacts.   </p> <p>My 'rule of thumb' here is: if you can bend the belt down a bit by applying some pressure with your finger onto it but you still feel a good amount of resistance, then it's a good sign that you're in the right area of tension. So start from there and if you feel or need to do so, play around with different belt tensions while printing the same bject over and over again for finding the best tension for your setup.   </p> Some Notes On Belt Tension <p>People often recommend \"Tighten your belts!\", but that's actually not always the solution if artifacts like layer shifts occur. As a matter of fact, I made many different tests with my Kobra Neos and evaluated the different influences of factors like belt tension, wheel position, quality of ball bearings of the wheels, a trammed vs. untrammed frame/printer setup and so on. And to be honest: a belt being too loose in terms of being the cause for severe problems only occured when it was really that loose that even someone who has no experience at all with this would notice it. If a belt is sagging, I'd assume that a user would notice that and realizes that this can't be good.   </p> <p>Don't get me wrong - of course different tensions of the belts do have a certain influence of the quality of the print, and it might be worth to finetune the tension for getting the last little amount of perfection out of your print. And yes, of course, if a belt is too loose, then it can slip or it can cause layer shifts due to a slight 'lag' which occurs when the motors start to drive the belt or when a sudden change of the direction occurs. But: a belt being too tight can cause artifacts as well. Not only that - it can and actually will harm the hardware. Users reported not only snapped belts or harmed motors, one even reported a bent bracket where the motor of the Y-axis was mount to. So, believe me or not: even though there are people in forums and on YouTube who claim that a belt can't be too tight - it definitely can.  </p> <p>Using the abovementioned 'method' of roughly setting your belt tension to a 'medium' value, I found that other factors have a much bigger impact on the print quality and the reliability and well-functioning of the whole printer. Let me give you two short examples to show you what I mean:  </p> <ul> <li>If your v-slot wheels or SG15 bearings are too tight, of course you also need to increase the belt tension - but in that case it's not the belt tension what's causing the issue in the first place, it's the wrong position of the wheels.  </li> <li>If you have bad ball bearings at the wheels (which is actually most likely the case due to the cheap parts being used) or SG15 rollers, then those may cause an irregular/inconsistent movement of the wheels and you can feel regular 'hiccups' while moving the belonging part (like the bedgantry or the printhead). You can feel how you have to apply more force at certain spots when moving the part manually by hand, as it feels like it's getting stuck at certain spots. So a belt being too loose isn't the cause of the problem here and therefore tightening up your belt isn't the solution - replacing the bad bearings with some quality ones is.  </li> </ul> <p>So, use your brain and don't always follow the typical answers like \"Tighten you belts!\" when you're experiencing issues like layer shifts for example. Instead, look at your printer more 'holistic' and see the different parts which are working together in the end. Pay attention to each of them, once again starting by inspecting the frame and making sure everything is still trammed and set up well here. Due to vibrations and repetitive motions screws can come loose, parts can and will wear out and therefore a frame or other parts you set up a while ago can and will come out of alignment by time.</p>"},{"location":"hardware/axes/#maintenance_3","title":"Maintenance","text":"<p>You should inspect the belts and the belonging parts like pulleys etc from time to time to make sure everything is in a good condition and nothing will suddenly break.  </p> <p>Belt </p> <ul> <li>Check the belt tension from time to time as it might wear out and lengthen a bit. </li> <li>Check the teeth of the belt if they are still good looking or if they're worn out or if even some teethe are missing.</li> <li>Check if you can see any cracks or other damage at the belt.</li> </ul> <p>Pulleys</p> <ul> <li>Check the pulleys of the motors which are driving the belts.

Of course the belt itself can be physically harmed as well when grinding across sharp edges or when it gets old, but you should notice that when examining the belt every now and then when doing the regular maintenace of your printer.  </p> <p>If you encounter a snapped belt, get yourself a good quality one as a replacement - don't go with the cheapest no-name product you can get. I'd suggest to look out for an original \"Gates Powergrip\u00ae\" belt. You can get them in different lengths, like one or five meters. Then get yourself some of those metal clamps you have to crimp at the ends of the belts as well. If you feel insecure about how to properly add those clamps to the belt and how to actually crimp them properly, practice crimping a few to your old broken belt.  </p> <p>Crimp one of those clamps to one end of the belt, measure the belonging length of the belt and apply the other one, then cut off the rest of it.

Before connecting it to the mainboard though, take your multimeter and identify the coils by probing the pins of the motor's connector! Compare your findings with the ones from the stock motor - you might have to switch the position of certain wires inside of the plug.  </p> Identifying The Coils And Connections <p>When you want to use a different motor than the stock ones, it's most likely the case that the coils are connected to different pins of the 6 pin connector of the motor. The best would be if you take a multimeter and probe the pins to see which ones belong to a coil. So let me go over this procedure really quick - don't worry, you can't harm the motor by doing the following.  </p> <p>Take your multimeter and set it either to continuity measurement or to resistance measurement. Either one will work - if you have the option for continuity measurements, choose that one though as they often offer a little buzzer which makes a sound when continuity is given.  </p> <p>Unplug the motor (of course) and hold one of the two probes of the multimeter to one of the pins of the 6 pin connector of the motor. I personally like to start at the left side, so hold one probe onto the very left pin. Then use the other probe and touch the other pins - one after another. Make sure that both tips of your probes really make contact to the desired pins. Once you found the corresponding pin for the very left sided pin you placed your first probe onto, mark that. Then move the probe to the next pin and repeat the process. In the end you'll come up with having two 'paired' pins identified - each pair belongs to one coil.  </p> <p>For illustration purposes, the following picture shows the coils of a motor from a Kobra Neo and a Creality motor.    </p> <p> </p> <p>If the pairing of your probed pins is the same - fine, you can connect the motor right away.  </p> <p>If the pairing is different, like at the Creality motor shown in the picture, you need to pull out two wires of the connector of the motor cable (one wire of one coil each!), switch them accordingly and insert them back in the connector housing. At the shown example with the stock vs. the Creality motor, you'd just switch the position of the two inner wires here.  </p> <p>You can pull out the wires (inclduing the attached metal contacts) by pressing down a tiny metal latch of that contact. Take something like a needle or a tiny screwdriver for that. Gently press that latch down and slightly pull on the wire - the wire with the contact being attached will come out. Once you put it into the correct position, just push it back into the belonging hole - but mind the orientation! You might hear a little \"click\" sound, but check if the wire really got into position by looking after that latch and by pulling at the wire - it shouldn't come out.  </p> <p>After a final check if everything is still ok, connect the motor - it should work now.  </p> <p>If it happens that the polarity of the coils/wiring is wrong, you'll experience a stuttering and probably noise-making motor.

So, in a summary: the SG15 bearings should touch the rail and sit on it well without any noticeable amount of play which would cause a wiggeling, but they should still be able to move smoothly. The following picture shows a bearing which is too far away from the rail, you can clearly see the huge gap between the rail and the grove of the bearing (circled in red).

The following picture shows the upper part where you can see the the top bearing blocks both lead screws rest in, the pulleys and the timing belt which connects both lead screws.  </p> <p></p> <p>The lead screws have 8mm in diameter with 8mm lead ('distance' of one complete rotation), 2mm pitch and 4 starts and has a length of 350mm. At the bottom part of the lead screw there's a 10mm long unthreaded part and at the top this part is 20mm long, the outer diameter of these shafts is 5mm.  </p> <p>The rod which is directly driven by the motor is mounted to the 5mm shaft of the motor by a rigid coupler at the bottom. The rod which is driven by the belt then is mounted to a bearing block at the bottom which holds it in place. Both top ends of the rods are held in place by a bearing block at the top. At this end, right underneath the bearing block, a pulley is attached to both screws, which are then connected by a closed loop belt. All these bearings where the lead screws sit in, the pulleys as well as the coupler to the motor are 5mm in diameter to take up the unthreaded part of the rods.</p> <p>In between the lead screws are guided by a spring loaded POM anti-backlash nut which is mounted to the x-axis gantry. When the lead screws turn, it the drives the x-axis gantry up and down accordingly.    </p> <p>In the following picture you can see the bottom part of the lead screw which is driven directly by the motor. From the bottom to the top you can see the motor being mounted to the rail of the z-axis frame, the coupler which connects the shaft of the motor and the lead screw, a part of the lead screw and the anti-backlash nut which is mounted to the x-axis gantry.  </p> <p> </p> <p>Z-Axis Drives X-Axis Gantry</p> <p>The lead screws drive the x-axis gantry up and down along the z-axis aluminum frame parts, so check the section x-axis gantry as well for adjusting the position of the brackets the v-slot wheels are mounted to as well as for adjusting the position of the wheels! </p> Choosing A Layer Height: The \"Magic Number\" <p>I'd like to mention the so called \"magic number\" for choosing layer heights at this time already, even though you probably didn't reach the sections about the individual parts of the z-axis lead screw system yet: it's 0.04mm.  </p> <p>Let me explain it a bit: when the head at the x-gantry is being moved up and down along the z-axis which is done by the lead screws, it's smart to choose your layer heights in a way that for each layer full motor steps are taken. One step is 0.04mm, so it's better to set e.g. 0.2mm or 0.16mm layer heights instead of e.g. 0.18mm or 0.15mm.  </p> <p>To understand it better, I'll try to give a simple explanation of what a full step of a motor is and what microstepping of a motor is, before I'll explain the 'math' behind the magic number. If you're interested in a more precise and proper technical description of how exactly a stepper motor works, please search the web for an adequate source. For a better understanding of the following description, see the following picture which shows the inside of a stepper motor. </p> <p>We have motors which execute 200 full steps to rotate the shaft of the motor for a full 360\u00b0 rotation, where each step is a movement of 1.8\u00b0 (there are also 'high resolution' stepper motors which do 400 steps with 0.9\u00b0 movement per full step, but we have motors which do the mentioned 200 steps). This is based on how the motor is built in the inside with it's permanent magnet motor and the stator coils which make the shaft of the motor turn in the end.  At each of these 200 steps with 1.8\u00b0 movement, the motor 'rests' in that specific position due to the positions of the permanent magnets in the inside. Means, these positions are 'given', there don't occur any deviations or misalignments.  </p> <p>Then we have microstepping. Microstepping is dividing one full step in a number of smaller steps, the so called microsteps. In our case we have 16 microsteps being used (other setups can use up to 256 microsteps). For making this mircostepping possible, the belonging stepper motor driver (which is a chip on the mainboard, in this case a TMC2209) adjusts the current of the stator coil in a way that the permanent magnet motor will be hold in a position between two full steps. So the motor doesn't 'rest' in a certain position due to the force of the magnets, it's being 'hold' in an intermediate position between two magnets which are next to each other so to say. In our case with a 1.8\u00b0 rotation per full step and 16 subsequent microsteps, each microstep is a movement of 0.0025mm, because one full step is 0.04mm. But, due to the fact that the motor is being 'hold' in that position between two magnets like it's floating, this movement isn't 100% precise. So in reality it's not exactly altering it's position of 0.0025mm when a microstep is executed, it's more like it's moving approximately 0.0025mm. And this is already the reason why it's smart to choose a layer height which is a multiple of full steps, just because the movement is more 'precise' due to the fact that the motor moves from magnet to magnet instead of being hold in a somewhat-position in between. There are other additional reasons as well like that the torque is heavily reduced when microstepping, but I won't go into further details about that.     </p> <p>Now that you know the basic principle of how a stepper motor works and what the difference of a full step and a microstep is, you might wonder why the up and down movement of the z-axis is 0.04mm for a full step now.  Here's the 'math' behind it:  </p> <ul> <li>The stepper motor of the z-axis does 200 steps per revolution (1.8\u00b0 per full step for a 360\u00b0 rotation).</li> <li>The lead screw is 8mm in diameter.  </li> <li>There are 4 starts (= thread paths) at the lead screw.  </li> <li>The lead screw has 2mm pitch.  </li> <li>4 starts multiplied by 2mm pitch is 8mm lead per one full rotation of the lead screw. In other words: for every 360\u00b0 rotation the motor shaft and therefore the lead screw does, the z-axis moves (either up or down) 8mm.    Therefore we have the 8mm lead divided by 200 steps per revolution, which then results in 0.04mm movement per step.  </li> </ul> <p>Doing the math, you'll realize that e.g. 0.16mm layer height = 4 full steps, 0.2mm l.h. = 5 full steps and so on. Now we remember that a microstep is ~0.0025mm. So when choosing a layer height like e.g. 0.15mm, the motor has to do 3 full steps (3*0.04mm=0.12mm) and 12 microsteps (12*0.0025mm=0.03mm). But because a microstep is a position which is somewhat 'floating' due to the fact that it's being held between two magnets instead of 'resting' in a position facing one magnet, the chosen 0.15mm layer height is not as precise as the 0.16mm or 0.2mm which is a multiple of 0.04mm full steps. Therefore it's smart to always choose layer heights which can be fully divided by 0.04mm.  </p> <p>Now you probably ask yourself if it really affects the outcome of the printed part in the end and if it's worth it paying attention to this, and imho the answer \"maybe not that much\" and \"yes\". You probably won't be able to tell the difference in terms of quality when looking at two parts with the bare eye. But what's the advantage of using a layer height of 0.15mm (where a somewhat unprecise microstepping has to be used) instead of just choosing 0.16mm layer height (which consists of full steps)? Exactly - there isn't any advantage. So, imho: yes, it's worth paying attention to this, because if we can somewhat improve the quality and accuracy of a print by just making one smart decision - then why shouldn't we do it?   </p>"},{"location":"hardware/axes/#lead-screws","title":"Lead Screws","text":"<p>The lead screws are T8x8 type of lead screws, means they are 8mm in diameter with 8mm lead ('distance' of one complete rotation), 2mm pitch and 4 starts.

I personally like to start at the left side, so hold one probe onto the very left pin. Then use the other probe and touch the other pins - one after another. Make sure that both tips of your probes really make contact to the desired pins. Once you found the corresponding pin for the very left sided pin you placed your first probe onto, mark that. Then move the probe to the next pin and repeat the process.

At the shown example with the stock vs. the Creality motor, you'd just switch the position of the two inner wires here.  </p> <p>You can pull out the wires (inclduing the attached metal contacts) by pressing down a tiny metal latch of that contact. Take something like a needle or a tiny screwdriver for that. Gently press that latch down and slightly pull on the wire - the wire with the contact being attached will come out. Once you put it into the correct position, just push it back into the belonging hole - but mind the orientation! You might hear a little \"click\" sound, but check if the wire really got into position by looking after that latch and by pulling at the wire - it shouldn't come out.  </p> <p>After a final check if everything is still ok, connect the motor - it should work now.  </p> <p>If it happens that the polarity of the coils/wiring is wrong, you'll experience a stuttering and probably noise-making motor.

Check from time to time that the coupler didn't come loose somehow. </li> <li>Make sure the rod is clean, there shouldn't stick debris or dirt on it as it could/would block the movement. The following picture shows a partially clogged thread due to debris of the anti-backlash nut.   In this case the motor was still able to move the rod across it, but you could notice a tiny jerk at that point.  </li> <li>If you need to clean it, it's advisable to disassamble the whole rod system including the coupler and the anti-backlash nut. The following picture shows the Neo where the coupler, rod and nut are dismounted.   See the other expandable box for some guidances about dis- and reassembling the z-axis lead screw system.  </li> <li>Spray e.g. WD-40 on the rod to loosen old sticky oil and debris. Then take a toothbrush or something like that for being able to reach the bottom of the thread also and clean it up. Make sure to not leave any particles from the anti-backlash nut like shown in the picture below or any dirt stuck on it.  </li> <li>After this procedure, clean the WD-40 off of the rod by using e.g. car break cleaner or silicone remover spray. It'll wash off everything, you can also use an old cloth to wipe it (but make sure that no textile fibres will stick in the thread somehow). </li> <li>After you cleaned and dried it, inspect the rod and the anti-backlash nut.   Are there any dents in the thread or any kind of deformation that shouldn't be there? Is it really straight or is it somehow bent (roll it across a flat surface)? If so, it would be best to get a new lead screw and replace it.    Is the anti-backlash nut worn out like in the picture shown below? If so, replace it, maybe use a brass one instead (note: until now I didn't find a brass one that fits the distance of the holes though).   When you mount the anti-backlash nut to the belonging part of the frame, I personally like to not tighten up the screws completely to allow a bit of a movement on the horizontal plane.  </li> <li>If everything is fine though and you want to mount the lead screw to the printer again, add a little lube to the rod. Don't be excessive here and drown it with oil - just use a tiny bit to make it glide better. Don't use WD-40 or grease which contains graphite or MoS2!  I personally like to use PTFE spray first, let it dry and then put some synthetic lube on which is made for mountainbike chains as it uses to stick a bit better onto the metal. If you have, you can also use synthetic grease like PTFE or silicone grease (\"Super Lube\"), it should work even better. You can draw a line of oil all along one side of the rod from the bottom to the top and then put the rod between your fingers and turn it. By doing so, the excessive oil will build up at your fingers and will also reach the bottom of the rod. Wipe off any excessive amount of oil afterwards again - you don't want to have oil dripping down on your motor later! Tip: to avoid dripping oil down to the motor, I personally wrap a pipe cleaner around the rod right above the coupler. If by time a drop or two will move down, the pipe cleaner will absorb it.     </li> <li>Before installing the rod into the coupler of the motor again, clean the last inch of the bottom again by using the car break cleaner and the cloth. Try to get it as much degreased as possible, so that it doesn't start to slip inside of the coupler later. </li> <li>When you're done reassembling everything and you home the printhead, you only should hear the low noise of the turning motor now - so now grinding noise from the anti-backlash nut or something like that.  </li> </ul> <p>Don't Use WD-40 for Lubrication</p> <p>Do yourself a favour and never use WD-40 for lubrication as it's not a lubricant! It's perfectly fine for washing off old oil from the threaded rod, but it's not a sufficient lubrification! People use to think WD-40 is the perfect solution for pretty much everything, but they aren't aware of the fact that -due to the chemical recipe it's made of- it's absolutely not sufficient for getting parts lubed mid- to longterm. Fact is, that the chemicals inside of it will even wash off any grease or oil, it can harm POM and rubber and so on. As an example: So let's say you want to lubricate your bike chain and use WD-40 to do so, you'll basically wash away the existent lubrification  which is inside the chain - therefore the chain will be worn out pretty quick. You'll also harm the sealings. If you don't believe me, make a little test by yourself: take an air baloon, pump it up, spray WD-40 onto it and wait..  </p> Timing Belt Maintenace <p>You should inspect the timing belt and the belonging parts like pulleys and bearing blocks etc from time to time to make sure everything is in a good condition and nothing will suddenly break.  </p> <ul> <li>Belt:</li> <li>Check the belt tension from time to time as it might wear out and lengthen a bit. </li> <li>Check the teeth of the belt if they are still good looking or if they're worn out or if even some teethe are missing.</li> <li> <p>Check if you can see any cracks or other damage at the belt.</p> </li> <li> <p>Pulleys:  </p> </li> <li>Check the pulleys at the top which are driving the timing belt. Are they also looking ok? Did the grub/set screws become loose?  </li> </ul> Disassembling The Lead Screw System <p>If you need to disassemble the z-axis lead screw system, there are a few things that one should be aware of. Besides that, the necessary steps are pretty easy and self-explaing, so I'll go over them just really quick.  </p> <ul> <li>First, you should somehow fixate the gantry of the x-axis to get the load off of the lead screw. You can do so by e.g. putting two soupcans onto the bed, each on one side (left/right) and then lower the gantry until it rests onto them. Or you can move the gantry up and fixate it with some velcro straps or cable ties to the blue plastic part at the top.  </li> <li>Now unplug the wire from the stepper motor, just to be on the safe side. The printer itself is also switched off of course.  </li> <li>Loosen the two screws at the coupler which conects the motor shaft and the lead screw. </li> <li>Now you can turn the lead screw by hand to screw it out of the anti-backlash nut. After you completely took it out, dismount the anti-backlash nut from the holder at the frame as well.   If you fixated the x-axis gantry at the top like shown in the picture above, you can also just screw the lead screw a bit higher into the anti-backlash nut so that it comes out of the coupler and then you just dismount the anti-backlash nut from the holder at the frame. After that you can take out the lead screw with the nut still on and take off the nut then.  </li> <li>Take off the coupler from the motor shaft as well for being able to inspect everything.  </li> </ul> Reassembling The Lead Screw System <p>If you need to resassemble the z-axis lead screw system, there are a few things that one should be aware of. Besides that, the necessary steps are pretty easy and self-explaing, so I'll go over them just really quick.  </p> <ul> <li>To reassemble everything, just follow your steps backwards.  However, there are a few things you should pay attention to now:  </li> <li>Make sure the motor shaft and the bottom tip of the lead screw are free of oil or grease to avoid slipping of the coupler.  </li> <li>Mount the coupler to the bottom of the lead screw first and tighten the screw. Then put it onto the motor shaft and tighten the screw. The coupler should not move or wiggle on either part.    </li> <li>When installing the anti-backlash nut, make sure you press it together firmly while inserting the lead screw, so that the spring inside these two parts of the anti-backlash nut is completely compressed and loaded. </li> <li>Before finally installing the lead screw, loosen up the screws of the motor holder a bit so that the motor itself can move a bit on the horizontal plane. Then install the lead screw, align everything, screw the anti-backlash nut (attention: don't forget to really press it together!) to the belonging holder and align the motor once again. Then finally tighten up the screws of the motor mount. By doing so you do the best you can to get the parts vertically aligned as much as possible.  </li> </ul> <p> </p>"},{"location":"hardware/bed/","title":"Bed","text":""},{"location":"hardware/bed/#bed","title":"Bed","text":"Specifications Bedplate: 230x230mm, 3mm thick aluminum plate with PCB heating coil Magnetic Foil: 230x230mm PEI Plate: 230x230mm, spring steel, textured on one side Thermistor: 24V, 100k NTC \"ATC Semitec 104GT-2\" type, AWG22 wire, two pinned JST XH 2.54 connector PCB Heating Coil: 24V, ~180W, ~3.2Ohm resistance, AWG14 wire Bedmount: 7x14mm rigid spacers/bushings, 4x22mm countersunk head screws Silicone Block: 12x13mm, spring loaded Tool height gauge sensor (z-offset): 10mm diameter (round), spring loaded Acceleration sensor: LIS2DW12 <p>The bed consists of a 3mm aluminum bedplate with the heating coil being attached to the underside as a PCB.

The hotter the thermistor gets, the lower the resistance value will be; the colder the thermistor gets, the bigger the resistance will be. So at e.g. 20\u00b0C bed temperature the resistance will be ~125k Ohm, at 30\u00b0C it'll be ~81k Ohm. There are general data sheets for this kind of thermistor to find with list the different resistance values at given temperatures. However, these values can slightly vary, depending on the manufacturer and the type of the 100k thermistor (e.g.: EPCOS vs. ATC 104 vs. General 3950).   </p> Execute PID Tuning For The Bed <p>To make sure the heating algorithm can work as expected and keeps the fluctuation of the temperature as low as possible, execute a PID tuning for the bed.

You can get special insulation mats for 3d printers which meet the requirements for this (like being suited for higher temperatures and being flame retardant) for a few bucks. See the expandable textblock below for some tips about the installation.   Make sure you order the correct size (preferrably a bit bigger) which is 230x230mm as that's the size of the bedplate itself.  </p> <p>The following picture shows an insulated bedplate.  </p> <p></p> <p>By insulating the bed the temperature won't fluctuate as much as before, it heats up faster and it takes less energy to keep the desired temperature (so you actually lower the power consumption). It also takes longer for the bed to cool down which became impressively clear after doing a PID tune for the bed and comparing the graphs of before and after adding the insulation as the following screenshots will show. The first screenshot shows the bed temperature (blue graph) before the insulation while doing a PID tuning. The temperature is set to 60\u00b0C, after reaching that temperature the bed cools down to 55\u00b0C and heats up to 60\u00b0C again (and so on). The second screenshot shows the same process but with installed insulation. You can clearly see that it takes longer to cool down after reaching the 60\u00b0C as the blue graph of the second screenshot isn't declining as steep and fast to the 55\u00b0C target temperature as the one in the first screenshot. </p> <p>After adding the insulation, the temperature didn't fluctuate anymore at all during a print, even when I opened the window from time to time - the graph was just a straight line. So I'm actually highly satisfied with this and can strongly recommend insulating the bedplate. However, I have to mention that I didn't print with higher bed temperatures than 60-70\u00b0C yet, so I don't know how good the insulation will stay in place when printing with bedtemps like ~100\u00b0, but I hope it'll still work out fine..      </p> <p>Mind The Gap!</p> <p>When adding insulation, it's extremely important to keep an eye on the clearing underneath the bed! You don't want to risk the insulation hitting the bracket of the y-axis motor mount, so pay attention to that!  </p> Adding The Insulation <p>Before I'll go into the steps about how to apply the insulation, I have to point out a few things first:  </p> <ul> <li>You'll need longer spacers and screws due to the thickness of the insulation (which is about 9-10mm most of the time)! </li> <li>You'll need to raise the whole bedplate to avoid contact between the insulation and the motor mount at the back of the construction.     If you use the beforementioned 25mm springs and longer screws, you should be fine as they are longer then the stock spacers anyway.     If you'll use the stock spacers or silicone spacers of about the same size, you can add bolt nuts underneath to raise the bed. However, it's advisable though to get yourself longer spacers then!   </li> <li> <p>It's also advisable to have Kapton tape on hand to cover the whole underside of the bedplate with it (before you actually apply the insulation) and to secure the edges and sides of the insulation (after applying the insulation)!     Make sure that no bubbles are trapped between the Kapton tape and the surface of the bed's underside then! And do a proper cleaning of the surface to avoid that the tape will (partially) come off!   </p> </li> <li> <p>For adding the insulation, you need to dismount the bedplate from the gantry by taking out the four screws (remove the PEI coated plate first tho). Be careful with the wires when moving the plate. Also dismount the acceleration sensor and carefully move it out of the bed's underside you want to insulate. Put the plate onto the insulation (but don't peel off the protective layer of the adhesive yet!), align it and mark the four holes of the screws.  </p> </li> <li>Then place the bed upside down on a flat and clean surface - wipe the surface beforehand tho to make sure that there's no dirt or even metal chips which would press into or stick onto the magnetic surface. Now use IPA or (which I prefer) silicone remover to wipe the underside of the bed where the insulation should be applied to and clean off any dirt or grease from your fingers.  </li> <li>Now lay down the insulation onto the bed like if you would apply it (but still with the protective layer on the adhesive!) and adjust the position. Mark the area where the wires are connected to the bed as well and cut away that part of the insulation. </li> <li>Place the spacers above the premarked holes and cut away the insulation in that area as well, so that the spacers will touch the plate later without any insulation between. I'd recommend to mark the areas that should be cut and then take the insulation away from the bedplate, so that you don't harm the surface when using a sharp knife or so.   </li> <li>When it comes down to finally apply the insulation, I personally would suggest to cover the whole surface of the bed with Kapton tape first, just in case you'd have to tear off the insulation in the future. I also added two layers of Kapton tape especially above the contacts and the little piece of foam of the thermistor in the center of the bed and marked that area roughly at the insulation, just in case I'd have to replace the thermistor in the future. Make sure there are no bubbles trapped underneath the Kapton tape though!  |     Note: Looking back, I now would remove that piece of foam which covers the thermistor in the middle to make sure the insulation covers the bed without any air trapped in between! Cover that hole of the thermistor with Kapton tape though before you apply the insulation.  </li> <li>Pay attention to add a sufficient electronical insulation underneath the area of the accelaration sensor. Since the cover of the bed's insulation is made from aluminum and the pins at the back ofthe accelerometer's PCB aren't protected, you could create a shortcut if they get in touch! </li> <li>Once everything is done and prepared, you can finally apply the insulation. Make sure you start at one side to avoid any bubbles, you want the insulation to stick on the bed equally. If some of the insulation protrudes beyond the plate, cut it off. The following picture shows the applied insulation.  </li> <li>I highly recommend to additionally secure the insulation by using some pieces of Kapton tape as well to ensure that the edges and sides of the insulation won't come loose. Don't skip this step, as the insulation most likely will come off sooner or later at the sides and edges (at least mine did).    </li> <li>Then add the spacers and the screws and mount the bed onto the gantry again. Make sure that the insulation doesn't touch the construction and the motor mount at the back, the bed has to move as free as before. So move the bedplate manually to see if everything is fine and if there's enough clearance between the insulation and the other parts.  </li> <li>If you used adjustable spacers, tram the bed again.  </li> <li>When switching on the printer, make sure you proceed with executing an ABL procedure, adjusting the z-offset due to the raised bed and execute a PID tuning of the bed now and save the new values to the EEPROM.  </li> </ul>"},{"location":"hardware/bed/#magnetic-foil","title":"Magnetic Foil","text":"<p>On top of the aluminum bedplate there's a magnetic foil applied. If you order a spare part heat bed, then you'll most likely only get the aluminum bedplate, but not the magnetic foil. So you'll have to get yourself a magnetic foil as well. If you choose a foil from the aftermarket, make sure to get the correct size. The bedplate is 230x230mm, but actually most of the foils being available on the market seem to be 235x235mm. That's fine though, as you can easily cut off any pieces of foil which are exceeding the dimensions of the bedplate then.

Also make sure that no dust or anything else is left on the plate when attempting to attach the magnetic foil then.  </p> <p>When applying the magnetic foil, peel off about an inch of the protective film of the glued side of the foil and position the foil along one of the edges of the bedplate. Avoid touching the glued side! Make sure to position the foil correctly at the first attempt as you don't want to put yourself in the position where you have to pull off the foil again. Bend the foil a bit and then wipe along that stripe you already put on the bed from the middle to the outer edges with slight pressure. Pay attention to get the foil onto the bed smooth and even - there shouldn't be any bubbles of trapped air or even 'wrinkles' of the foil! If everything worked out well for that first stripe, slowly pull off the protective film while applying the foil onto the bedplate in the described way. Means, go slowly in small increments and always apply pressure by wiping from the center to the sides for avoiding trapped air.  </p> <p>Once you're done, wipe from the center of the bedplate to the sides once again while applying a bit of more pressure. Then heat up the bed to about 40-50\u00b0C (so that it's still safe for you to touch it without burning yourself) and let it sit for about 5min like that. Then wipe over it once again while applying pressure to make sure the foil is properly attached. Pay special attention to the egdes and long corners and make sure the foil really is attached well there.  </p> <p>If you bought a 235x235mm or even bigger foil, cut off the protruding parts by using a scalpel or sharp knife.   </p>"},{"location":"hardware/bed/#pei-plate","title":"PEI Plate","text":"<p>The bed uses a removable 230x230mm PEI-coated spring steel plate which makes it easy to remove the printed object.  </p> <p> </p> <p>The plate that comes with the printer is textured on one side.

To clean it, you can   <ul> <li>wash the plate using regular dishwasher soap and water (don't use the kind of 'soft', 'creamy' or 'balm' soap though), </li> <li>use isopropyl alcohol (IPA) or </li> <li>use silicone remover spray (it's the stuff the guys use to clean the surface before spraypainting a car, I personally use this and can highly recommend it).  </li> </ul> </li> <li>Already touching the plate with your fingers leads to a little amoung of grease left there which already might be enough to cause problems for your print to stick on the bed, so maybe always use disposable gloves when touching it, taking it off or repositioning it.</li> <li>If there's a rest of filament stuck on the plate, never try to scratch it off with metal or other sharp materials as you don't want to harm the PEI coating. Let it cool down completely and try to peel it off. If that doesn't work well (depends on the materiall you were using), heat up the bed and try to peel off the filament then. If that also doesn't work, take off the plate and heat up the area using your hot air gun - sooner or later you'll be able to peel it off. However, be careful to not overheat and maybe harm the coating though.  </li> </ul> <p>If you cleaned the bed properly, got your z-offset dialed in and use the correct bed temperature for the type of filament you're using, there's no need to mess around with gluesticks, hairspray, blue tape or whatever! The PEI plate really does work great!</p> <p>Don't Use Acetone For Cleaning The PEI Plate</p> <p>Some people seem to be using Acetone on a regular basis for cleaning the PEI plate - this isn't advisable as Acetone does harm the PEI coating. It won't completely destroy it immediately, but it will harm it when being applied more often. Acetone seems to somehow 'attack' the PEI coating and makes it soft in the first place, like it dissolves it. However, I heard from people who had serious problems with new PEI plates to get prints to stick on them even after thorough cleaning. They solved that issue by wiping off the bed one time using Acetone - which I think is the better solution than pulling out the grinder and sanding down the the surface of the PEI coating.  </p>"},{"location":"hardware/bed/#z-offset-sensor","title":"Z-Offset Sensor","text":"<p>The z-offset sensor is located at the rear left hand side of the bedplate, next to the bed's wiring connector and the silicone block for wiping the nozzle.

At this point this is just mentioned here for demonstration purposes only, I'm not yet recommending to modify the Kobra 2 Pro like this. This is only due to the assumption that the springs that are needed for the following mod might add some instability to the bedplate, which could negatively effect the outcome when printing at the maximum speeds of 500mm/s and 20.00mm/s\u00b2 acceleration Anycubic is advertising for this machine.*   </p> <p>I did a bit of tinkering and modded the bedmount to a 3 point bed mount instead of the classic 4 point mount.  </p> <p>The reason for that is simple, but let me explain it a bit. When I started with 3d printing and noticed how the bedplates are mounted to the gantry using 4 mounting points, I was actually a bit irritated. I got even more irritated after I discovered that this seems to be a common method at bedslingers, even when they offer manual bed tramming like at an Ender 3 for example. Afaik, the best method to tram a rigid and flat surface is by using three points with two points being located along one axis (let's say the y-axis) and the third point being located perpendicular to that axis (so this is the x-axis in this example) at the (opposite) side in the middle of those two points:   - One of those two points located along the same axis is then used as the reference - you mount the plate there and never touch it again. - The second point at this axis is then used for adjusting the tilt along this axis (in this example along the y-axis), it's called \"pitch\". - The third point at the (opposite) side which is located in 'between' those first two mounting points is then used to adjust the tilt along that axis being perpendicular towards the first one (so in this example along the x-axis). This point is referred to as \"roll\". So when attempting to tram/level that surface then, you only have to adjust the pitch first and then adjust the roll. By doing so, you (should) end up with a perfectly trammed/leveled surface.</p> <p>So seeing all those bedslingers having the bed mounted to the gantry using four mounting points, one in each corner, I actually got really confused and started doubting and thinking about what I've learned in the past before I started to get my hands on a 3d printer. Maybe it was a 4 point mounting because of the bed being heated up? Maybe it was because the plate was pretty thin? But then the effect of heating it up and tramming it by tightening 4 screws in a somewhat 'pattern' must result in a weird warped surface withe the effect and outcome would be pretty much unpredictable!? So I did a bit of a research and thankfully discovered an article where exactly this circumstance is being described and explained for 3d printers. I highly recommend reading it! </p> <p>So, long story short: I decided trying to mod my printer's gantry and bedmount to a 3 point system.  To keep this section 'short', please see the expandable textbox below for the further description.  </p> 3 Point Bed Mount Mod <p>I gathered through my workshop and found an aluminum pofile which seemed to be useful for this attempt. I cut two pieces and drilled the belonging holes (the distance was about 164mm and I used a 5mm drill which gave me a bit of a play while installing it): one at each end for mounting the profiles to the bedplate and the gantry using the existing holes and threads, and one in the exact middle for the screw which then would be my 'roll' mounting point. The holes in the middle had to have a bit of an offset to each other as I used L-shaped aluminum profiles for better stability, so that the profiles won't hit each other when lowering the bed.    </p> <p> </p> <p>After mounting a screw to the middle of the part which will be attached to the bedplate, I then mounted the parts to the bedgantry and the bed itself. As I have insulation added to the bedplate, I had to use bushings/spacers so that the insulation won't be compressed at the two mounting holes. I used some slightly too short spacers here first, which immediately lead to a bent bedplate due to the insulation pushing against the bed, especially in the middle section. After swapping out those spacers and using longer ones, everything worked out fine. Of course I didn't found screws with the perfect length, but as I didn't want to drive t o the hardware store just for two screws and I didn't want to cut the original screws, I ended up using those. I also drilled the existing holes in the bedplate a tiny bit bigger for allowing a bit of movement which should take care of the expanding material while heating up.  After adding a spring to that screw in the middle, I then mounted everything together.  </p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>This is how it looks like in total from the front. I took the picture with the construction being untrammed to show the tilt (which will be adjusted by the 'roll' then) of the right side better.  </p> <p></p> <p>Right now I still have to take off the PEI plate (or at least lift the left front corner) for accessing and adjusting the screw for the pitch (because that one is still screwed into the thread of the gantry) which I chose the front left screw should be (the back left screw is my reference), the screw for the roll (which is now the screw in the middle at the right side) I can access from underneath the bed though which makes it easy to adjust. I'll probably end up changing the setup for the screw of the pitch as well. </p> <p>I then continued with a rough tramming without the PEI plate being applied, adjusting only the 'pitch' and then the 'roll' after having the 'reference' set to the desired height. After that, I put on the pEI plate and excetuted the probing for a bedmesh (7x7 grid using Klipper) with the bed being cold - the result looked promising.  </p> <p></p> <p>Then I heated up the bed and immediately did a new bedmesh - and I was actually kinda shocked, as I've never seen a heavily warped bed like that before. The promising thing though was, that the warp was somewhat consistent - it looked like a wave instead of a crooked pillow like before when being mounted at the 4 points.  </p> <p></p> <p>I then let it settle for about 10-15min before executing another probing sequence.  </p> <p></p> <p>As you can see, there is still some room for finetuning, like lowering the front by adjusting the pitch and adding some Kapton tape to certain spots as well for getting the bed as flat as possible overall, but as I was too lazy at that point and had stuff to print, I didn't do it then.  </p> <p>Conclusion: so, will I do this mod at my other Neos as well and can I recommend it? Yes, absolutely. I might try to get a gantry from the aftermarket which already offers the option for this kind of 3 point mounting system and which is (hopefully) more rigid overall though, as the whole gantry itself really appears pretty flimsy to me. I'm not sure about that yet though, as I like to tinker and modify it with spending the less money I can - but if I'll end up buying such a gantry, I'll add pictures here and let you know how it went.  </p>"},{"location":"hardware/bed/#anycubic-leviq-20-automatic-bed-leveling-function","title":"Anycubic LeviQ 2.0 - Automatic Bed 'Leveling' Function","text":"<p>The printer comes with an automatic 25 point bed 'leveling' function called \"Anycubic LeviQ 2.0\".

We (try) to get the machine and certain parts of it aligned perfectly, like axes and parts being square, parallel, perpendicular and equidistant towards each other. For example, we try to set up the frame being mounted perfectly square, the z-axis frame being perpendicular to the base frame, the x-axis gantry being perpendicular to the z-axis frame and the bed being parallel and equidistant to the x-axis gantry and the printhead/nozzle. It's a technical term which is also used at CNC machines for example and this is the correct nomenclature. And as a matter of fact, this is also the case with 3d printers. Point.  </p> <p>\"Leveling\" though is the process of bringing something like a shelf, a table or a framed picture hanging at the wall into the position that it's perpendicular to gravity so to say. Most of the time you do so by taking a bubble level or a self-leveling laser. But this is NOT how you 'level' the bed of your 3d printer for example! </p> <p>Yes, I'm highly aware of the fact that the majority of the 3d printing community uses the term 'leveling', that people say \"Level your bed!\" and that the marketing guys and gals of the companies use the (even more misleading!) term \"Automatic Bed Leveling\" (which is even worse as it suggests that the process will actually 'level' the bed itself - which it obviously doesn't). But that doesn't mean that I have to follow that misleading road.  So besides the fact that this isn't the correct nomenclature (seriously, I'm not the grammar police - I'm a German guy who speaks a little bit of English..), my 'problem' with this term is that it's just really misleading!  </p> <p>How many beginners are pulling out their bubble level, put it on the bed or the x-axis gantry to check if it's leveled and maybe even shim out the table the printer stands on - just to come to the conclusion that their bed or gantry is leveled? Believe it or not: many - whether you came across those users while trying to help them or not. You can use a 3d printer on a tilted table - if the printer is trammed, it'll still print fine.   </p> <p>So to all those haters out there: yes, I will continue to use the correct term \"tramming\", no matter how much you'll attack and try to insult me. And no, I don't do it because I want to show the world that I know the correct term, I do it because I want to avoid that beginners become frustrated because they just get it wrong. And if you haters would start to actually do the same, then maybe one day there might occur a shift in the 'consciousness' of the community and the correct term would be used on a regular basis. Seriously, try to help people out by just using the correct term for making them realize that it's not about how perpendicular the bed or gantry is towards gravity - and stop harrassing people who already do so.  </p> <p>Even though \"tramming\" the bed isn't really possible when using the rigid stock spacers of the bedplate these printers come with, there is something one can and should do though: check if those spacers are all of the same height. This is really important, so better don't skip this step! </p> <p>If you're using adjustable spacers, then you'll be able to actually tram the bed itself.  </p> <p>If necessary, you can add Kapton tape on the magnetic surface of the bed underneath the PEI plate later to equalize warped or dented areas as much as possible. If you do so, make sure to check if the z-offset sensor still has the perfect height position!    </p> <p>I'll describe the belonging tramming process for each case in the following.  </p> \"Tramming\" When Using The Rigid Stock Spacers <p>When using the rigid stock spacers the printer came with, dismount the bedplate from the bedgantry and take out those four silver metal spacers. Then put them next to each other on a flat surface and/or measure them using a caliper. They might not be all of the same height, which will lead to a somewhat crooked, tilted or 'warped' bed.  </p> <p>Now you could either look for other spacers you might be using, put washers or other suitable material (e.g. gasket material) of the needed thickness under them when remounting or (what I'd recommend to do) sand them down to the smallest of the four spacers for achieving an equal height. When doing so, put the sandpaper on a flat surface and carefully rub the spacers across it - pay attention that you do this while holding the spacer absolutely perpendicular! You don't want to end up with a spacer where one end is sanded off tilted! </p> <p>Once you're done and all four spacers are of equal height, reassemble everything. Then proceed with tramming the x-axis gantry in relation to the bed.   </p> Tramming When Using Adjustable Spacers <p>You could also use adjustable spacers like silicone spacers or springs instead of those rigid spacers. That'll put you in the position of really being able to tram the bed. However, if doing so you not only need to be precise when tramming the bed, but you should proceed with tramming the x-axis gantry in relation to the frame first. This is really important as it will ensure that the x-axis gantry is parallel to the base frame. Once this step is done, you can proceed with tramming the bed itself.     </p> <p>When you want to tram the bed by adjusting the tension of the springs or silicone spacers to pull down a side or an edge of the bed, be careful to not bend the bed itself by tightening up just one corner too much. Try to push down one side of the bed and adjust two screws at a time.   I personally tram the bed by adding just a little bit of load to the spacers, so that the bed doesn't wobble.  </p> <p>For actually tramming the bed now, you'll have to move the printhead to all of the four corners and adjust the height of the belonging edge of the bed by tightening or loosening the belonging screw. I'd suppose to start with the left backhand corner and rotate clockwise. Take off the PEI plate and place an object onto the edge of the bed. It doesn't matter if this object is like 5mm or 5cm high as you're not setting the z-offset yet. It's just being used to ensure that the bedplate will be at the same height in relation to the printhead at all four corners. You need to make sure that you'll still be able to access the screw form the top though, so don't place the object right above the screw. Then lower the printhead manually until the nozzle or the ABL sensor just touches that object. Then move the object to the next corner and move the printhead across it. Make sure that you absolutely don't move the head along the z-axis by accident, so that you don't somehow change the height of it! If the head is positioned too low and there isn't enough space to fit the object between the bed and the head, tighten the screw for lowering the bedplate. If there's too much space, loosen the screw a bit until the nozzle/ABL sensor touches the object again. Proceed with the other corners like that. Once you're done with all four corners, do another round and check if everything still fits. Most likely it won't as it affects the other edges when adjusting the height of one edge. When you're done with this round as well, put on the PEI plate, move the lead screw manually for raising the head and place the object in the first corner again. Lower the head and check all four edges once again if everything is correct.  When you're done, make sure the screws won't turn themselves loose due to the vibration, so add e.g. an additional lock nut as well.     </p>"},{"location":"hardware/bed/#probable-issue-broken-wiring","title":"Probable Issue: Broken Wiring","text":"<p>There's a probable (upcoming) issue which is worth getting it's own section: breaking wires of the bed's wiring. There are (besides the wiring for the aceleration sensor and the z-offset sensor) two types of wires at the bed: the thin ones which are the wires for the bed's thermistor and the thicker ones which are the wires for supplying the 24V DC to the coil at the underside of the bed for heating up the bed. Due to repetive motion and the design, these wires might start to break over time. To be more precise: the thin strands of the wires inside of the insulation start to break. Therefore the resistance of those wires will increase until the point is reached that all of the strands are broken and there's no contact given anymore.  </p> <p>This breaking of the wires is a common issue at the Kobra Go and Neo, but here at the Kobra 2 Pro it seems that Anycubic used slightly longer wires. So hopefully this will not be such a common issue, but I'll go a bit into detail here anyway, just in case this problem occurs.  </p> <p>In the beginning you'll most likely notice this when you have an error message appearing which tells you that the bedtemp is abnormal (I didn't come across the specific error message yet, so I can't tell you right now how exactly the message will be). Even though you can fix this issue by replacing the wires of the thermistor as described in the next sections, sooner or later this will also happen with the thicker wires. And even though this can be fixed as well by replacing the wires, it's not as easy 'detectable' as with the wring of the thermistor, as there won't be an error message if strands of the 24V wires start to break and therefore the resistance becomes bigger. Unfortunately this breaking of the 24V wires is a potential risk of a fire hazard though, as the wire will heat up at that particular spot where it starts to break - due to the increasing resistance and the higher current running through these wires compared to the wires of the thermistor. The more the wires break and the higher the resistance will become here, the hotter the wire will become as well - until the insulation might melt and (worst case) the whole wire starts catching fire.      </p> <p>So, besides keeping an eye on that during the regular maintenance you're doing, there might be something you could do to minimize the risk of premature breaking wires. Read the expandable textbox to see what I did to hopefully minimize the risk.  </p> <p>If you have to replace the wirings, I'd suggest to use slightly longer (and thicker) high-flex wires, as that'll allow a slightly bigger range of motion, assuming that it'll have a positive effect on the overall bending as well. In that case you might also think about routing the wires differently. Some people add wire chains, and even though it seems to be a good idea in general, you should pay attention to the bending radius of the chain as well as to the size of the chain itself. You don't want to squish the wires in there and you don't want to make them rub against each other or against the chain too much as well.  </p> <p>See the following sections for how to fix this problem.  </p>"},{"location":"hardware/bed/#mod-wiring-harness-support","title":"MOD: Wiring Harness Support","text":"<p>The problem of breaking wires here is caused by the wires being too short in the first place, causing the effect that the wires will bend right behind that black plastic cap. So the first and best solution would be to either extend the existing wires or e.g. add an external MOSFET to the back of the printer's frame which then indirectly elongates the wiring as well.  </p> <p>However, even then the wires are prone to still start bending right behind the black plastic cap as well, even though the bending won't be as much 'hard' with longer wires than it would originally be.  </p> <p>To minimize this effect, I experimented with different solutions. The main goal for me here was to extend the bending area. As cablechains are having/causing different issues, I didn't go with those but experimented with some solutions you can easily make up yourself. I don't have that one and only final solution right now as I'm still experimenting with different mods at my Neos for testing what might be the best here. However, right now three simple 'hacks' seem to work - at least a bit, as I didn't run into the problem of broken wires here yet (..knock on wood..). To keep this section as short as possible, I'll go over each of them in an expandable textbox as usual.  </p> Duct-Tape <p>The first 'hack' is to actually just wrap some layers of duct tape around the plastic cap and the first inch or two of the wiring. By doing so, you'll stiffen up the wires a bit in that first section right behind the cap, avoiding the punctual bending. You need to make sure that the whole construction won't be too stiff as it should still be able to bend overall though, otherwise you'll provoke the same issue right after the attached tape. As I'm using my printers in an enclosure, this solution didn't last long though. The heat inside the enclosure made the glue of the tape warm and it lost contact to the black plastic cap. So I personally can't recommend this one.  </p> Self-Sealing/Welding Tape <p>The second 'hack' is actually kind of the same like the duct tape method, but instead of wrapping the self-sealing tape around the outside of the plastic cap, you wrap it around the wires. I forgot to take a picture of it, but it's fairly simple, so let me explain it a bit. - You cut the cabletie which holds the wire inside that plastic cap and take the whole wire harness thing out. - Then you wrap self-sealing tape around it, also in the area which will be inside of that cap later. So I'd say cover an area of about 2-3 inches with several layers, while applying more layers in the front part (towards that soldered contacts).   Make sure the wire is still able to easily bend in that area, you don't want to have it too stiff which would just lead to the circumstance that the sharp bending would occur right behind the taped area. - Now fiddle that wire back into place at the plastic cap like it was before and secure the position with a new cabletie. - That's it :)  </p> <p>For the sake of simplicity, I'd recommend this solution as it's easy to apply, even with the stock setup. If you don't know or have self-sealing / self-welding tape yet, give it a try. It's really great and comes in handy in several cases.   </p> Self-Sealing/Welding Tape And A Silicone Tube <p>The third option I tried is actually kind of similar to the one being previously mentioned, but instead of only using self-sealing tape, I used a piece of silicone tube in addition.  - First, I cut the cabletie which holds the whole wire 'package' to the black plastic cap. - Then I took a piece silicone tubing which I cut at one side and placed it across that specific section of the wire. - I then wrapped self-welding/sealing tape across it and secured everything again with a cabletie.   You can see this 'hack' at the following picture.     </p> <p>I have to admit though that I probably exxagerated it as the additional silicone tube made it quite stiff. So if you want to go with this solution, keep an eye on the thickness and stiffness of the tube as well as how many layers of tape you apply.    </p> Spring And Heat Shrink Tubings <p>The last method I'd like to mention is the one using a semi-stiff spring and some heat shrink tubings.  </p> <ul> <li>Disconnect the wires and pull the whole wiring harness through a semi-stiff spring as shown in the following picture. </li> <li>Then pull the wiring harness through a heat shrink tube which then goes in between the wires and the spring to avoid that the spring rubs on the wires and harms the insulation. </li> <li>Place the spring with the wires in the plastic cap and add a cabletie to hold it in place. </li> <li>Now pull the wires through a bigger heat shrink tube and place that one across the end of the spring and the wires that come out of it, to secure everything here. By doing so, you'll reduce the motion of the wires in the spring itself and stabilize the wire a bit. When the wires will be pulled/moved, they won't be bent at the spot right after the spring and won't be moved around in the spring as well.   The following picture shows the final asssembly. </li> </ul> <p>This is actually my preferred solution, BUT: you have to pay attention to use a spring which isn't too stiff! I had one laying around in my drawers at my workshop, so I can't give you any further specs. Best would be to check at a hardware shop and bend the spring to make sure it bends easily. You don't want to stiffen it up too much, you just want it to act as a guide for when the wires are being bent.  </p>"},{"location":"hardware/bed/#checking-and-fixing-the-electric-circuit-and-the-thermistor","title":"Checking And Fixing The Electric Circuit And The Thermistor","text":"<p>If problems occur with the electric circuit or the thermistor, you can check each of them for localizing the cause of the error.

If your multimeter doesn't have this function, you can measure the resistance instead.  </p> <p>However, it's advisable to measure the resistance, even though your multimeter offers the function of probing for continuity, because it might be the case that a wire still passes the check for continuity, but that individual strands of the wire are broken. This causes problems if those strands lose contact permanently or during movement of the bed, as it leads to a higher resistance.  </p> <ul> <li>At the 24V wires this can lead to the circumstance that the wire will get hot at that spot, that the insulation will melt, that a shortcut might occur and it might even occur that it causes a fire.   </li> <li>At the thermistor wires this can cause the ERR: MINTEMP error message. When the problem of breaking strands starts to occur, you'll experience the upcoming of this error message when the bed is moving and reaches a certain position. In that case those broken strands lose contact, which leads to a suddenly changing resistance value. As the temperature is interpreted by the reisistance value of the bed's thermistor, a suddenly changing resistance is interpreted as a sudden change in the temperature. If this change is 'big' enough, the belonging error message will be triggered.     </li> </ul> <p>Procedure: </p> <ul> <li>Unplug the belonging connector and check the belonging wire(s) by probing at the beginning and the end of the wire. So place one probe of the multimeter at the connector and the other probe at the solder joint of the wire you want to check.  </li> <li>If continuity is given and/or no or a very small resistance (it should be really close to zero resistance though!) is measured, start bending the wire slowly and pay attention to the measured resistance. Take a few iterations when doing so, bend the wire in different radii, at different speed, at different spots. If at one point the resistance suddenly changes, the problematic and broken part of the wire is detected.  </li> </ul> Measuring / Checking The Thermistor <p>You can check if a thermistor is working or if it's broken by measuring the resistance of it using a multimeter. As described above, at a temperature of 25\u00b0C the resistance should be ~100k Ohm (nominal restistance: R25\u00b0C = 100 k\u03a9 \u00b1 1%). If the temperature is lower, the resistance value will be higher; if the temperature is higher, the resistance value will be lower. The following table gives you some typical resistance values of a 100K thermistor type 3950 (generic) for temperatures around room temperature. The values might slightly vary from the one you'll get, but they should be pretty close.  </p> Temperature in \u00b0C Resistance in k\u03a9 (kilo Ohm) 15\u00b0 ~157 k\u03a9 20\u00b0 ~125 k\u03a9 25\u00b0 ~100 k\u03a9 30\u00b0 ~81 k\u03a9 35\u00b0 ~65 k\u03a9 <p>Set your multimeter to resistance testing for a higher Ohm range - in most cases the multimeters have different settings, usually 200/2000/20K/200K/20M -&gt; use the setting \"200K\" here. </p> <p>You can measure by probing the belonging wires at the plug of the mainboard (unplug it!), that would be the white connector labeled as \"T1\" with the green and blue wire (see the chapter \"Mainboard\" -&gt; \"TriGorilla V_3.0.6 (Stock)\" for a picture of the location).  </p> <ul> <li>Keep in mind though that by probing at the connector, you also measure the wiring itself, which would be needed if you want to check if you maybe have a broken wiring. Means, if there are e.g. broken wires, the thermistor won't work even if the thermistor itself is still fine.  </li> <li>If you don't want to check the wiring, you could measure at the soldering joints right at the bed - in this case you also check the conductor path of the PCB itself (keep in mind that some glue across the solder pad area might prevent a successful measurement, so make sure you really make contact to the solder joints!).  </li> <li>If you really want to only measure the thermistor itself (which is advisable if you're in doubt and are thinking about changing the thermistor), then you'd have to pull off the little foamy piece in the middle of the underside of the bed and measure the resistance right at the soldering joints or legs of the thermistor itself.  </li> </ul> Checking The 24V Heating Circuit Of The PCB <p>You can also check the 24V heating circuit of the PCB itself, like when the bed doesn't heat up (in this case make sure to also measure if 24V are coming from the belonging screw terminal for the heated bed at the mainboard!).

You could get yourself a spare switch and replace the broken one, or you can just get yourself a whole new filament runout sensor.      </p> <p> </p>"},{"location":"hardware/frame/","title":"Frame","text":""},{"location":"hardware/frame/#frame","title":"Frame","text":"Tram The Frame <p>As already mentioned in the introduction of this hardware section, I strongly recommend to check and tram the whole construction of the printer's frame first. Check the base frame as well as the z-axis frame even before mounting them together. </p> <p>Check the whole frame if everything is square, rectangular and perpendicular, check all screws, bolts, belts, wheels, electrical connectors - literally everything. This will save you a lot of hassle, frustration and headaches later..  </p> <p>Seriously, I can't encourage you enough to do a complete check-up and maintenance of your printer before you even try to print the first time.  Not only will you get to know your printer better, it'll most likely save you headaches and many hours of fiddling around trying to find the perfect print settings - just to despair of weird artifacts showing up on prints just when you thought you found the perfect settings because they were caused by a sticky and partially clogged lead screw thread or so.   </p> <p>Get yourself a good carpenter's square in a 90\u00b0 rectangular angle. Make sure the tool itself actually really is square - especially the cheap ones being offered often lack of precision and aren't really square themself. When attempting to measure the parts of the frame and bring them into the correct position, always measure at both sides of the construction. By doing so you can mostly avoid any misalignments which might occur if only checking at one side and maybe not really paying attention to the parts of the rails which are further away. You can also strengthen the construction itself by adding certain coponents which make sure the construction is and stays in a rectangular position. It's also advisable to use some screw glue like Loctite, just to make sure screws won't come loose over time due to the vibrations of the machine.  </p> <p>Take your time setting up the frame of the printer (and the axes and wheels etc. after doing so as well), be as precise as you can be. Every misalignment here will most likely cause some weird issues later which might be hard to find or even solve if you're not remembering that maybe the construction itself might be the cause.   </p> <p>The machine comes preassembled with basically two major frame parts (which consist of individual parts) which I'd call the base frame and the z-axis frame.  </p> <p>The following picture shows what I'd call the base frame.  </p> <p> </p> <p>On there you mount the z-axis frame which is shown in the following pictures (frontside view / backside view).  </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p>Don't Put It On The Side For Mounting</p> <p>I always see people putting the whole construction on the side, with the printer resting on the side of the baseframe and the according site of the z-frame (or, to be more precise, only certain parts of it touching the desk!). Then they insert the screws and tighten them up, turn the printer around on the other side and do the same there. But by doing so, you'll risk that the z-fame won't be mounted perpendicular to the baseframe.  </p> <p>So what I'd recommend is to put the printer to the edge of a table, letting one side stick out a bit where you want to put in the screws. Now put the z-fame on top of the base frame and make sure that the z-frame really is perpendicular to the base frame using a carpenter's square while tightening up the screws as shown in the following picture.  </p> <p> </p> <p>After mounting both parts together, you'll already have the printer standing in front of you.  </p> Kobra 2 Pro frontview Kobra 2 Pro backview <p> </p>"},{"location":"hardware/hw_index/","title":"Introduction","text":""},{"location":"hardware/hw_index/#introduction","title":"Introduction","text":"<p>This hardware section covers the hardware topics like the mainboard, the printhead and so on. You'll find pictures and notes about the parts, how to disassemble or maintenace them and sometimes also suggestions for spare parts which could be used. Just click on the belonging chapter of the part where the desired part is located at, so e.g. in case you're looking for informations about the hotend, see the chapter \"Printhead\".  </p> <p>If I found mods which seem meaningful to me and which fit in the certain area where the part is located at the printer, I'll list them at the end of the belonging chapter (like e.g. a link to an STL file of an upgraded fan duct can be found in the subchapter \"Printhead\" and so on). Mods or STL files which don't fit in a special 'area' of the printer that I made a subchapter about can be found in the subchapter \"Other\" (like e.g. raisers for the whole printer to stand higher).  </p> <p>Because you're entering the hardware part right now, there is something I really want to recommend to you and I cannot emphasize it enough:  before you even start printing anything, check the whole construction first. Check the whole frame if everything is square, rectangular and perpendicular, check all screws, bolts, belts, wheels, electrical connectors - really just everything. And (really important): also disassemble the lead screw system, clean it and lubricate it and pay attention to vertical alignment when reassembling! </p> <p>You might think now \"Why should I waste my time with that? I got the machine preassembled and why should I even disassemble the lead screw system?!?\" - and I understand that. Sure, you want to dive right into the beautiful ocean of 3D printing. And you will. But as with jumping into the unknown ocean from a cliff high above, you need to assure that everything is safe. And in this case with your new 3D printer it's actually not only that. The point is: even if you got the machine preassembled, not everything might be assembled and mounted correctly. Some bolts or screws might not be tight enough or might be overtightened. The wheels might be too loose or too tight, same with the belts. And about the lead screw: just touch it. Does it feel kinda wet and oily, or does it feel more sticky and resinous instead? I'd bet it's more the last. And especially this will lead to a pretty quick wear out (in this case of the anti-backlash nut) and weird artifacts on your prints (due to the inconsistent movement) which will drive you crazy after hours of calibration prints.  </p> <p>So - lean back, read the specific chapters and then grab your tools. Sooner or later you'll have to tinker anyway and by doing it right at the beginning of your journey you'll most likely be able to fix any possible hardware problem that occurs by yourself. No need to call Anycubic's warranty service to ask for a spare hotend because your nozzle is clogged or whatever (yes, I know, but people really do that..). No weeks of waiting until the part finally arrives and you realize that somebody has to take care of the tinkering part also.  </p> <p>Get to know this machine and give it some love, then it'll pay you back with reliability and beautiful prints.    </p> <p>Happy tinkering! </p> <p> </p>"},{"location":"hardware/mainboard/","title":"Mainboard","text":""},{"location":"hardware/mainboard/#mainboard","title":"Mainboard","text":"<p>It has to be noticed that Anycubic apparently changed the mainboard revisions at a certain point after the Kobra 2 Pro/Plus/Max (which all used to have the same type of mainboard built in) hit the market. In the 'beginning', these printers were equipped with the \"Trigorilla Spe A_v1.0.0\". This mainboard was designed to run the newly developed KobraOS firmware (which isn't Marlin anymore, but Anycubic's own firmware based on Klipper; see the chapter \"Firmware\" for further information).    Probably around summer 2024, printers with \"Trigorilla Spe B_v1.0.x\" mainboards were sold - it's unclear if this only happened with a few smaller batches or if this change was permanent since then. These mainboards are equipped with a HC32F460 chip, just like other Trigorilla mainboards before that were running Marlin firmware and which could have been flashed with Klipper. Also, afaik, the Kobra 3 uses the \"Trigorilla Spe B_v1.1.x., which might be a later revision of the Spe_B-revision used in the Kobra 2 Pro/Plus/Max at a certain point. The Kobra 3 also runs KobraOS, but a different version than the one that has been used at the Kobra 2 Pro/Plus/Max printers before. The important thing now is that there is a modded KobraOS of the Kobra 3 available, which not only seems to work fine with the B-revision of the mentioned mainboard, but it also offers access and enhanced functionality. Unfortunately, I personally don't have such a mainboard and therefore I can't test it, but imho it might even be possible now to install a native Klipper on this B-revision mainboards.

For doing so, you need to access the underside of the printer. The housing where the mainboard is located in is about 238x142mm and it's inserted in between the side rails of the base frame (see the expandable textbox below for further pictures).</p> <p>Once you opened the lid, you can see that there's quite a lot of space left inside of the enclosure. If one re-routes the wires, it should be possible to add an external MOSFET for the bed here.  </p> <p> </p> <p>Please see the expandable textbox below for further instructions and illustrations about how to actually open the housing and access the PCB.  </p> How To Open The Mainboard's Housing <ul> <li>When looking at the underside of the machine, you can see the housing of the mainboard being located it the front, between the outer rails of the baseframe. </li> <li>In the middle you can see two hex screws. These are holding the whole housing in place as they're screwed into the Y-rail in the middle, but they also hold down the lid. So take them out first.  </li> <li>After you took out the screws, you then have to 'unclip' the lid of the housing. As you can see in the following picture, there are plastic 'noses' which rest in the belonging nothes of the housing's base part. Use a thin tool like a screwdriver or a plectrum and insert it in the slot between the housing's lid and the base part.   You then need to carefully bend the base part slightly away to make the lid come out. I'd suggest to start at one edge like show in the picture below - once you have lifted that up, it's much easier to go around the rest. </li> <li>Once you have released all clips, I'd recommend to unplug the flat ribbon cable of the control unit and lead it through the belonging cutout of the lid for being able to flip the lid over.  </li> <li>Once you have done that, you can flip the lid over as shown in the following picture. </li> <li>Be careful and don't rip off the wire of the fan!    </li> </ul> <p>That's it - you successfully opened the housing of the mainboard! </p> <ul> <li>If you need to take out the whole mainboard now, take out the four screws located in the corners of the mainboard.   Then lift up the PCB in the back first, as the USB connectors are positioned in those cutouts in the front of the housing. </li> </ul> <p>For reassembling everything, just follow the steps in reverse. In addition to that, mind the following:  </p> <ul> <li>Pay attention to the wires though, so that they aren't positioned between the posts where the screws will be screwed through later.    </li> <li>Also mind the black ribbon cable of the control unit - don't forget to lead it through the belonging cutout of the lid and reconnect it to the control unit.  </li> <li>Also make sure to reconnect the black grounding wire at the lower right corner in case you took out the PCB.  </li> </ul> <p>If you want to take away the whole housing to e.g. place it outside an enclosure you put the printer in, mind the following:  </p> <ul> <li>You have to take off the mount which holds the control unit.  </li> <li>You have to pull out the black plastic cap of the face of the other side's rail. That one is just stuck in the aluminum frame, so you can pull it out. Be careful to not break those little plastic posts though which are shoved into the threads of the middle parts of the 4040 rail. </li> <li>See the following picture for getting an idea of how it should look like when all parts are dismounted for taking away the housing. </li> <li>You now have to disconnect all wires.  </li> <li>Once you have completed this step, you can then just pull out the enclosure. It's shoved in between those two outer rails of the base frame, some plastic noses are guiding it in one of the v-slots. </li> </ul> Add Ferrules To The 24V Wires! <p>The 24V wires already come with ferrules being added. If it happens that your specific machine doesn't come with ferrules but with tinned wires instead, it's highly advisable to cut off the tinned tips of the wires without a plug (power supply and heated bed) and add ferrules to them. Same goes for the case that a ferrule comes off - in that case, add a new one instead of just inserting the wire or tinning the end of it.     </p> <p>The reason why not using tinned ends is simple: when you are screwing down the soldered tip inside the clamp, the solder will get cracked a bit and may get deformed a bit as well. When the wire gets warm due to the current and the solder gets softer, the contact may become loose which could lead to malfunction or even cause fire in the last consequence. So it's always highly recommendable to just use proper ferrules! </p> Red Glue Across All Connectors <p>When you look at the mainboard, you'll see some red glue spread across all connectors.  That's just for securing the connnection. You can get that stuff off by carefully pulling it off. It works better if you warm up that stuff a little bit for making it more flexible, a hair dryer is good for that. It then becomes a bit softer and easier to be pulled off. Don't heat it up too much though as it'll become too soft then! You can also use a thin screwdriver to lift up a part of that stuff and then use some tweezers to grab it.    </p> <p>However, be very careful to  </p> <ul> <li>not harm the mainboard by slipping off with the screwdriver or tweezer!  </li> <li>not overheat the mainboards of parts of it when heating up that red glue!  </li> <li>not rip off the heatsinks of the stepper drivers!   This can happen really quick as they're just glued onto the stepper drivers with some thermal paste and the red glue is usually spread across the fins of the heatsinks as well!   So if you have to pull off that stuff from those connectors of the motor wiring, then make sure that you press down the heatsink with your finger when trying to pull that stuff off! </li> </ul>"},{"location":"hardware/mainboard/#connecting-to-the-printer-mainboard","title":"Connecting To The Printer / Mainboard","text":"<p>Anycubic doesn't allow any local access to the machine, neither via USB or via the inbuilt WiFi.

Generally speaking, you can use pretty much any generic mainboard, like from BTT or MKS, you just need to make sure that it can use 24V DC.   </p> <p>You also need the according stepper drivers for the mainboard you'll chose. Some mainboards have stepper drivers soldered onto them already, some come with sockets where you can plug the according stepper drivers into (often offered in bundels with according stepper drivers, most of the times TMC2209). I personally prefer the latter one, because it allows you to chose the type of stepper you want to use and it also gives you the option of swapping out a defective driver, if that ever happens to you. I personally used TMC2208 drivers at my mod (Kobra 2 Pro), but just because I already had them laying around. If I'd have to get some, I'd have chosen TMC2209, just because we can run them at slightly higher currents. Imho this is even more important at the bigger models like the Kobra 2 Plus and Max, because they have to move more mass (especially along the y-axis, due to the bigger build plate). If I'd be up to mod a Kobra 2 Max, I'd most likely even go with TMC2226 drivers, at least for the Y motor. Whichever stepper driver you'll end up using, make sure to adjust the <code>printer.cfg</code> accordingly. </p> <p>In the following, I'll list which kind of connectors you most likely will need - of course you have to check the according connectors at the specific maninboard you want to use.  </p> <p>Since the stock wiring for both the main cable which connects to the printhead (\"E-CON\") as well as for the cable which connects to the X-axis setup (\"X-CON\") come with specific connectors, you can either get yourself the corresponding connectors or just cut the given ones and retrofit the specific connectors which are needed for the mainboard you have chosen. You need a 14pin and a 24pin PHB 2.0 male connector. These connectors for the two main ribbon cables might be hard to find - I didn't find them at all in any store in Germany, but luckily one seller at AliExpress (\"YANDONG store\", store/912016358) had them (the 24pin connector was the one which was hard to find). The mentioned seller offers an already wired up connector with a male and a female plug, so you can just cut off the female connector and add the specific connectors. The following picture shows the wired 24pin version as well as a 14pin version you'd have to crimp yourself. </p> <p>Further on, you need a - 7pin XH 2.54 male connector for the Y-axis setup cable, - 7pin PH 2.0 male connector for the acceleration sensor of the bed, - 2pin PH 2.0 male connector for the z-offset switch.  </p> <p>You most likely will need 2pin, 3pin and 4pin XH 2.54 female connectors  and a decent crimping tool for setting up most of the wiring. You also might need some DuPont connectors and a 10pin IDC female connector (the latter one only if you want to use the ESP2 connector for connecting the acceleration sensors to SPI1 how I did it). In addition to that, you might need some wires, a soldering iron, heat shrink tubes, button connectors, ferrules and a crimping tool, M3 screws and nuts and last but not least a multimeter.

When using my adapterplate (which is 3mm thick) for mounting the MKS board into the stock housing, then it most likely won't fit (I actually didn't test it, I just eyeballed it). So I decided to mount the stock fan for the mainboard on the outside of the housing/lid. For doing so, just take a 2mm drill first of all and lead it through the existing holes of the lid's fan mounts. Make sure to not touch and harm the threads! Carefully drill through the lid. Once done, take a 3mm drill, flip the lid around and carefully enlargen the 2mm holes you just drilled (from the 'outside' so to say). Pay attention to just drill through the material, which is about 2-3mm thick - you don not want to drill all the way down and harm the threads! Now mount the fan to the outside. You can use the stock screws for that. Make sure the fan is pushing the air into the housing (the scoops should face the lid/inner side of the housing). Also mount the metal grill. Once done, you can lead the fan's wire through the slot of the lid where usually the ribbon cable of the control unit runs through.

I took the following pinout scheme from there and added the names of the according connectors - thanks to codexnovus for allowing me to use his picture! </p> <p>If you want to see which specific components I connected to which specific connectors at the MKS board (besides the ones I'll mentioned down below), just have a look at the <code>printer.cfg</code> I'm offering here. To make it easier for you, I made a table where you can see the according wiring/connections I made. Before showing that table here, let me point out a few things first though:   </p> <ol> <li> <p>Connections Of 24V, H+/H-, GND, CHASSIS_GND     When you look at the pinouts of the stock wiring, you'll notice that at the main ribbon cable that connects to the printhead (called \"E-CON\") there are the pins GND, CHASSIS GND, 24V and H+/H- given.  </p> <p>Basically the 24V and the GND are lead to the breakout board PCB of the printhead, from there the belonging components get the according connection. So you can can connect those ones to one of the two connectors of the MKS board which deliver the 24V continously - I personally used connector \"J5\" for that. Make sure to NOT connect CHASSIS GND as well here (see further down below)!  When you then make the connections for the individual parts like the printhead's fans, the thermistor and so on, look at the pinout and check the according pin assignment. Since you already connected 24V and GND, you then only have to connect the according signal pin to the MKS board. As an example: fan F0 (part cooling fan) needs 24V and 'F0', which is the signal (to be more precise: it's the individual PWM driven GND connection). Since it already gets the 24V from the head's breakout board where it's connected to and you already connected 24V to J5, you only need to connect 'F0' to the according connection at the MKS board - I used 'FAN1' = PC14 for that. The thermistor T0 of the hotend on the other hand connects to 'T0' and GND. Since you already connected GND to J5 and the thermistor gets that connection from the head's breakout board, you only have to connect 'T0' to the according pin at the MKS board - I used 'TH1' = PC1 for that.</p> <p>Then we have the CHASSIS GND at both the E-CON and X-CON ribbon cable connectors - basically this is protective earth. At the stock mainboard, we have copper plated mounting holes, where one wire is being connected to which then connects to the protective earth of the power supply. Since we don't have these copper plated mounting holes at the MKS board, you can just connect all CHASSIS GND wirings together with the wire that's running to the protective erath of the PSU.</p> <p>Then we have three H+ and H- connectors at the E-CON ribbon cable. These are the 24V connections for the heater cartridge. DON'T connect them together with the 24V and GND connections mentioned above!  Due to the higher current that will flow when heating up the cartridge heater for the hotend and the thin wires being used at the E-CON ribbon cable, we have three wires/connections for each H+ and H- here. You now have to bundle the H+ wires and connect them to an individual thicker wire. Same with the H- wires - bundle them up and connect an individual thicker wire to them. These two thicker wires now have to be connected to the according connector at the MKS board - I used 'HE0' = PE5 for that. Connect H+ to HE0+ and H- to HE0-.  </p> </li> <li> <p>Wiring Up The Motors     At the mentioned pinout scheme for the K2 Pro/Plus/Max, the four motor pins are called A1, A2, B1, B2.     At the scheme of the MKS board though, they're called 1A, 1B, 2A, 2B.     So when assembling the connectors of the motor wiring, you have to make sure to connect it as shown in the following table.  </p> Anycubic Pinout MKS Pinout A1 1A A2 1B B1 2A B2 2B <p>Don't connect A1 to 1A and then A2 to 2A - that won't work and will result in a non-functional motor setup and an error message at Klipper later. </p> </li> <li> <p>Z-Offset Sensor     I also connectected the z-offset sensor, even though I probably won't use it. Since I plan on adding an optical minimum limit switch for the z-axis (which I'll connect to \"Z-\" = PC8), I connected the z-offset sensor to \"Z +\" = ^PC4 (I think you need to have the <code>^</code> in front since that activates the pullup for that pin). I'll probably not use it, but I like to have it connected - just in case..</p> </li> <li> <p>Inductive Proximity Sensor / ABL Probe     The inductive proximity sensor is conencted to 24V, GND and the according signal pin labeled as 'LEVEL' at the pinout scheme at the printhead's breakout board. Since you already connected 24V and GND, you only have to connect the signal pin 'LEVEL' to the MKS board - I used the BLTOUCH connector = PA8 for that.     Don't worry about the 24V and the signal - due to the electronic circuit of the head's breakout board, the signal level will be just fine and won't harm the according connection of the MKS board.</p> </li> <li> <p>Fans     The MKS board has two fan connectors which can be PWM controlled: FAN1 (= PC14) and FAN2 (=PB1). I connected the part cooling fan F0 to FAN 1 and the heatsink cooling fan of the hotend F1 to FAN2.     I then connected the mainboard cooling fan to the 24V connector \"J4\" - that one provides 24V continously, so the mainboard cooling fan will run as soon as you switch on the printer. Attention: always mind the polarity! </p> </li> <li> <p>Acceleration Sensors     I decided to connect both of the acceleration sensors (printhead &amp; bed) to the same SPI bus.     Since I don't use an additional screen for the MKS board, I used the EXP2 connector (you either need a 10pin female IDC connector or just some female DuPont connectors) which is SPI1.  </p> <p>If you want to use an additional screen, you can't use this connector though, so you'd have to use a different SPI bus instead. In my opinion it should be possible to use the connector for the optional WiFi module which would be SPI2. If that doesn't work and you don't use the 5th stepper driver E1 for driving a second z-axis motor independently, you can also use that one - make sure to set the jumper for SPI mode accordingly.  </p> <p>Whichever SPI bus you'll use in the end, just connect the MISO, MOSI, SCLK, GND and 5V VCC of both sensors parallel to the according pins. Every CS pin of each sensor has to be connected to it's own pin then though. This is crucial - you can not connect the CS pins of the y- and the x-axis acceleration sensor to the same pin! I decided to connect the CS pin of the x-axis' acceleration sensor (printhead) to the SPI1's \"CS\" pin = PA8; for the CS pin of the y-axis' sensor (bed) I used the pin PA11. GND can be connected to the LOGIC GND as well, or just connect it to GND at the corresponding connection you end up using for the SPI connection. You then have to connect the 5V pin of the acceleration sensors to an according 5V pin at the MKS board - I used the 5V pin of the BLTOUCH connector for that.   </p> <p>The following screenshots show the results of the resonance measurements of my K2 Pro. </p> </li> </ol> <p>The following table shows the wiring/connections according to my <code>printer.cfg</code> - if you want to use e.g. a different SPI port for the acceleration sensors or an additional stepper driver for a 2nd z-motor, make sure to adjust the wiring/connections accordingly!  </p> Part Pinout Label MKS Connector Pin / Pin Assignment Probe / ABL Sensor E-CON: LEVEL BLTOUCH PA8 PA8 Acceleration Sensor  Printhead = X  E-CON E-CON: MOSI  E-CON: MISO  E-CON: SCLK  E-CON: CS  E-CON: 5V EXP2: SPI1_MOSI  EXP2: SPI1_MISO  EXP2: SPI1_SCK  EXP2: SPI1_CS  BLTOUCH: 5V PA7  PA6  PA5  PE10  (BLTOUCH: 5V) Acceleration Sensor  Bed = Y  ACC-SENSOR ACC-SENSOR: MOSI  ACC-SENSOR: MISO  ACC-SENSOR: SCLK  ACC-SENSOR: CS  ACC-SENSOR: 5V  ACC-SENSOR: GND EXP2: SPI1_MOSI  EXP2: SPI1_MISO  EXP2: SPI1_SCK  EXP2: BTN_EN2  BLTOUCH: 5V  J5 \u2192 24V - PA7  PA6  PA5  PE11  (BLTOUCH: 5V)  (J5 \u2192 24V -) Printhead's 24V main E-CON: 24V J5 \u2192 24V + (J5 \u2192 24V +) Printhead's GND main E-CON: GND J5 \u2192 24V - (J5 \u2192 24V -) Part Cooling Fan E-CON: F0 FAN1 PC14 Heatsink Cooling Fan E-CON: F1 FAN2 PB1 Thermistor Hotend E-CON: T0 TH1 PC1 Cartridge Heater E-CON: H+ / H- (3x) HE0+ / HE0- PE5 Thermistor Bed T1/GND TB1 PC0 Heater Bed HOTBED + / - H-BED + / - PA0 PE / Chassis GND E-/X-CON: CHASSIS GND PE-Wire PSU (PE-Wire PSU) Filament Runout Sensor X-CON: FILAMENT/GND MT_DET1 PA4/GND !PA4 X Limit Switch X-CON: X LIMIT/GND X PA15/GND !PA15 Y Limit Switch Y-CON: LIMIT/GND Y PD2/GND !PD2 Mainboard Cooling Fan MB-FAN + / - J4 \u2192 24V + / - (J4 \u2192 24V + / -) Z-Offset Sensor CALIBRATION S/GND Z+ PC4/GND ^PC4 Extruder Motor E-CON: A1/A2/B1/B2 E0-MOTOR: 1A/1B/2A/2B step: PD6 / dir: PD3 / enable: !PB3 / uart: PD9 X-Axis Motor X-CON: A1/A2/B1/B2 X-MOTOR: 1A/1B/2A/2B step: PE3 / dir: PE2 / enable: !PE4 / uart: PD5 Y-Axis Motor Y-CON: A1/A2/B1/B2 Y-MOTOR: 1A/1B/2A/2B step: PE0 / dir: PB9 / enable: !PE1 / uart: PD7 Z-Axis Motor ZL/ZR: A1/A2/B1/B2 Z1-MOTOR: 1A/1B/2A/2B step: PB5 / dir: PB4 / enable: !PB8 / uart: PD4 PSU 24V Main Power POWER PSU + / - POWER 12/24V + / - (POWER 12/24V + / -)"},{"location":"hardware/mainboard/#assembly","title":"Assembly","text":"<p>For assembling the whole setup, I'd suggest to first flash the <code>klipper.bin</code> onto the mainboard.

Even though the MOSFET on the mainboard is sufficient, it's an upgrade worth doing as it not only leads to the fact that the bed will be heated up slightly faster, but it also increases the security of the hole printer. The MOSFET of the mainboard doesn't have a heatsink and it may caused by overheating due to an excessive amount of current being drawn, especially when using higher bed temperatures. Due to the low clearance between the fan of the moainboard and the ground the printer stands on, the cooling isn't the best as well. When using an enclosure which then heats up as well, cooling gets even worse. If the board's MOSTFET dies, you most likely have to get a whole new mainboard then. Even though it's possible to solder a new one onto the board (if you're skilled to do that), additional components might have been harmed. To avoid that, it's therefore adviseable to add an external MOSFET which then takes the load - the one on the mainboard only acts as a signal for the external one to switch.  </p> <p>The 24V DC of the PSU will be connected to the belonging connector of the external MOSFET. The 24V DC line from the heated bed screw terminals will be connected with the belonging connector of the external MOSFET and the 24V DC wires of the heated bed will then be connected to the outlet of the external MOSFET. When the mainboard switches the onboard MOSFET, it will then trigger the external one to switch and lead the current to the heated bed. There are a few external MOSFETs on the market, most of them only have a \"signal\" connector. When using a mainboard with a dedicated 'signal' connector for this, it's then connected to that one.

If you'd know the weight of the empty spool, you could (more or less precise) calculate the amount in meters left on the spool by just putting the spool on a kitchen scale.  </p> <p>So if you have a favoured brand and an empty spool already, measure the weight of it and keep it in mind (or on a Post-It note ;) ). But what if you don't have an empty spool you could measure? In that case I have your back covered - check out this Wiki which lists many brands and the weights of the belonging spools. (If your specific type isn't listed, please reach out to the creators of that Wiki once your spool is empty and you were able to get the specific weight!)  </p> Calculating The Amoung Of Filament <p>It's said that a regular 1kg spool of 1.75mm filament contains about 330m of filament. To be on the safe side, I personally calculate with 300m per 1kg. That means 1000g = 300m, 100g = 30m and 10g = 1m. So when you wanna roughly calculate the amount of filament left on the spool before or even while printing, put the spool on a kitchen scale and read the weight. Then substract the spool's weight and you have the amount of filament left in grams. Convert that to meters and you'll get an idea if you're on the safe side or if you should have a new spool on hand.  </p> <p>Example: I'm using AzureFilm filament which comes with the newer spool design, those black ones with the holes. The spool's weight is 220g. The actual spool's weight with some filament left on there is 390g. So we can do the math: 390-220=170 - ok, so I have 170g filament on there. How many meters are that now? 100g of filament is about 30m, 10g about 3m. So: 30+(7*3)=51 - means, I have about 51m filament left on the spool, which would allow me to start my 3hrs print which uses 27m without the need to worry if I'll run out of filament. </p>"},{"location":"hardware/other/#spool-holder","title":"Spool Holder","text":"<p>The spool holder is mounted to the left side of the base frame.  </p> <p>Some people change the position and mount the spool holder to the top of the frame (you can find models for doing so at e.g. Printables.com and Thingiverse.com). However, due to the construction of the frame itself, the additional weight being put on top of it, the resulting impact of the (changing) weight on vibrations while printing (especially at this high-speed type of printer) and because of the poor roll-off behavior of the spool itself, I personally wouldn't do so. If you want to get rid of the stock spool holder mounted to the side due to the additional width of the hole printer setip, I'd suppose to use a spool holder solution which isn't attached to the printer itself and which uses ball bearings as well.  </p> Boxed Spool Holder <p>If you'd use a box with a lid which closes really well (best would be this kind of plastic box with the silicone sealing in the lid) and put a bag of desiccant in the box as well, you could also can keep the filament dry and dust-free. Just print yourself one of those ball bearing spool holders where you place the spool onto, drill a hole in the side of the box and feed the filament through. Then place it next to the printer or onto a shelf above it and you're good. Putting one of these cheap digital hygrometers in the box as well helps keeping an eye on the actual humidity inside of the box.  </p> <p>I personally used a cakebox with a lid which I mounted to an adjustable construction to the wall (because I couldn't get my hands on a decent box and ran across that cheap cakebox, so I couldn't resist). The spool itself is held by a bolt with some ball bearing spool holder. Of course I put a bag of desiccant and a cheap hygrometer in there as well. This solution isn't as air-tight as a box with a silicone sealed lid, but it does the job in my room fine. Plus, it keeps dust and my cats away from the filament as well.  </p> <p> |  </p> <p>At the printers which are located in an enclosure, I use one of those 4l cereal containers (see the section \"Filament Storage\" below) with a custom lid and a spool holder mechanism to feed the filament.  </p> Influence Of The Spool's Weight On Vibrations <p>I personally don't like the spool being attached to the top of the frame. Even though I do see the 'value' of it in saving space around the printer, I personally think that adding 1kg (or even 2kg as some people mount a second one on top as well) to this kind of construction isn't the best idea. Especially not at these high-speed style bedslingers.    </p> <p>The construction itself isn't the most rigid one anyway, and the higher the x-axis gantry rises along the z-axis, the stronger the vibrations become which are caused by the moving parts. Adding another kilogram or even more to the top now will enhance this effect, which will become even bigger when printing with higher speeds. Plus, the changing weight of the spool (due to the filament being used) causes a changing pattern of these vibrations.  </p> <p>By using Klipper and the Input Shaper functionality, we can measure the vibrations and apply certain algorithms to compensate them (which is somehow implemented -up to a certain degree- in the stock firmware as well). But due to the fact that the patterns of these vibrations alter with the changing weight of the spool(s), it's kinda counterproductive to mount the spool(s) on top. As I didn't had an empty and a full spool to test the vibrations for investigating this problem, a friend of mine was so kind to run these tests. Even though he uses a Creality Ender3 V2 Neo, the results are pretty impressive and allow to assume that the behaviour will be somewhat similar due to the pretty much same constructions of the printers.  </p> <p>I don't know how much this affects the outcome of the printed model in real life at the end, but as we try to eliminate factors that might have a negative effect anyway, I just wanted to show you this for making you aware of it.  </p> <p>So the following images show the outcomes of the Input Shaper measurements with an ADXL345 sensor being used.

Since some sorts of filament like PETG, TPU and Nylon are prone to take up moisture more than others (like PLA), you often need to actively dry it to avoid printing problems like artifacts and heavy stringing.

It's also smart to look up the typical glass transition temperature of the specific type of filament first of all.  </p> <p>After you dried your filament, make sure to store it somewhat airtight - like in a sealed bag or a sealed cereal container as you can see in the specific section further down below.  </p> Types Of Filament <p>The following article gives you a nice overview of the different types of filament available and what they're being used for: Best 3D Printer Filament: The Main Types in 2023</p> <p>In the following I'll show some solutions for drying your filament.  </p>"},{"location":"hardware/other/#typical-filament-dryer","title":"Typical Filament Dryer","text":"<p>Since I don't have one of those typical filament dryers you can buy, I can't show you a picture of those, but a quick internet search will show you various models. However, if you're looking out for a filament dryer, you should check for two things: 1) Check the maximum temperature the device can generate. This is especially important if you want to dry filaments which need higher temperatures. 2) Make sure to get yourself a dryer which comes with an inbuilt fan, so that the hot air can circulate in the drier. Cheap units often lack a fan and just have a heating element at the bottom. This then leads to the problem that the bottom of the spool gets warm (or even too hot) while the upper part of the spool doesn't reach the desired filament.  </p>"},{"location":"hardware/other/#food-dehydrator","title":"Food Dehydrator","text":"<p>I personally use a food dehydrator since they're intended to dry food and herbs, come with a built in fan already and are usually also cheaper than a 'dedicated' filament drier.

The cheapest and esiest solution is to place two long, thin and flat (~5mm) pieces of wood across the bed. On there, you put the spool flat/horizontally (= not standing upright) and then put a cardboard box over the spool. Make sure both the spool and the cardboard box are resting on the wooden sticks to allow circulation of the air. Poke some holes in the top of the cardboard box to allow that the moisture can evaporate.  </p>"},{"location":"hardware/other/#filament-storage","title":"Filament Storage","text":"<p>Storing your filament in a way that it's not only protected from dust and UV light, but also from moisture is the way to go. As always, you have plenty of options. You could put the used spool back in a bag and vaccum and seal it, use re-usable plastic bags with a zipper and a hole for using a pump to create a vaccum, put all of your spools in a big box which is as much sealed as possible or use individual sealed containers for each spool - just to name a few. After doing some tests with different storage solutions and measuring the humidity over time, I personally decided to go with the last option I just mentioned - and after observing the stability of the humidity and the filament, I really can recommend it. So let me go a bit into details about it.  </p> <p>I got myself some of those sealed cereal containers in the size of 4l (size is about ). The 1kg spools fit in there perfectly (at least the ones I tested - I didn't test the brands with those spools made from cardbox though and therefore I don't know if those may vary in the size), 2kg spools don't fit. These containers come with a sealed lid you can clip on the container. I printed a little mount for those cheap rectangular hygrometers and printed a mini spool holder as well, just to keep the spool in place a bit better (this isn't necessary though). I then also bought a big amount of silica gel (desiccant) and put 200g of it into some thin lady socks (I also tested those small packages which come with the spools, but those ones just don't take enough moisture imho). I got the orange version of the silica gel which turns to a dark green when being moist (don't get the stuff that turns blue as that's toxic) as it makes it easier to judge by a quick glance if the desiccant is still good to use. Adding some labels to the box helps identifying the different types of filament without the need to open the box and thake out the spool. I didn't type the colour, as I'm able to identify that through the box.  </p> <p>So, adding that 200g bag into an empty container got the humidity down to 10%. That was stable across time. After adding a fresh spool right out of the sealed bag, the humidity usually raised up to something between ~40-50%, which then dropped down to 10% again over time. This value was stable then over time. In my opinion this method doesn't only keep the humidity inside of the container low but it also dries the filament over time.   </p> <p>The following picture shows a setup like that.  </p> <p></p> <p>I designed a cap/insert for the lid's opening as I couldn't find any model that fit the specific triangle-like shaped opening. I made it in different variants, like with and without a hole to feed the filament through and with and without a cutout for the typical cheap hygrometer/thermometer units. The following picture shows one of those caps which I personally am using to feed filament right out of the container, it's the version with the hygrometer/thermometer unit and the 4mm hole.  </p> <p> </p> <p>You can find the models here: Caps/inserts for the lids of 4l cereal containers (filament storage &amp; feeding filament), 'triangle' shaped type  If you want to feed the filament right out of the box, I'd suggest to add a ball bearing mount for holding the spool. If you don't have any other feeding system, then I'd suggest to modify one of those containers for this purpose. You can also find guides about this solution and find models for printing different mounting solutions.  </p> Types Of Filament <p>The following article gives you a nice overview of the different types of filament available and what they're being used for: Best 3D Printer Filament: The Main Types in 2023</p>"},{"location":"hardware/other/#printer-enclosure","title":"Printer Enclosure","text":"<p>Using an enclosure has clear advantages and is even necessary for succesfully print certain types of filament. However, it might cause some problems as well. So here are a few things I'd like to mention about enclosures in general.   </p> <p>Let's talk about the downsides first, as there are only a few:   </p> <ul> <li>When you're only printing PLA, an enclosure which traps the heat might be counterproductive. PLA needs a proper cooling, therefore a heated chamber can cause some thermal issues like insufficient cooling of the printed parts. So when you're printing PLA and using an enclosure, it's best if you leave the enclosure as open as possible.  </li> <li>An enclosure usually takes more space than the printer itself just standing somewhere. You need additional space in the enclosure for being able to reach certain parts of the hardware comfortably.  </li> <li>The trapped heat in an enclosure puts some additional thermal stress on the printer itself. The active cooling of parts like the mainboard, the PSU, the heatsink and the printed part itself won't be as sufficient as if the the printer won't be trapped in a heated chamber. Besides that, motors might get hotter and parts like the POM wheels and the belts might be negatively affected by the heat as well. Depending on the design and size of the enclosure and the temperatures of the bed and the hotend being used for printing, the temperature inside of an enclosure can easily reach 40\u00b0C.  </li> <li>The risk of a fire hazard might be higher. Especially when using flammable material for building the enclosure.  </li> </ul> <p>The upsides though can clearly make up the beforementioned issues:  </p> <ul> <li>Your machine is protected from dust, pet hair and so on.  </li> <li>Depending on the design of the enclosure, you'll achieve a reduction of the noises and the fumes.  </li> <li>Printing certain types of filament will not only become easier (like PETG for example which is already pretty sensitive to a cool airstream hitting the bed), some even require the usage of an enclosure, like ABS for example.  </li> <li>You can integrate certain security functions like a smoke detector and even a fire distinguisher, which can reduce the risk of a fire hazard massively.   This is highly dependant on the material the enclosure is built from though - if you're using highly flammable material for insulating the inner parts of the enclosure or if you're building the enclosure from wood, then of course the whole enclosure itself will increase the risk as mentioned above. So make sure you're using proper material.  </li> </ul> <p>When thinking about using an enclosure, you'd have to think about the design itself, the size and the materials. If you have no idea to start from, you can find countless solutions as an inspiration across the web (a pretty popular and easy to build solution is the \"IKEA Lack enclosure\"). There are also prebuilt enclosures available as well as enclosures which I personally call \"tent style enclosures\" (or just \"tents\").  </p> <p>I personally ended up with getting myself two of those tent style enclosures, just because I like the idea of being able to fold it together and put it in the closet if I don't need it anymore. There are quite a few of these tents available, but when taking a closer look at the various offers you'll see that most of them are actually the same, just being branded differently. I call them \"generic\" ones. Only some of the tents available on the market seem to really differ from those \"generic\" ones, here the ones from Creality and SainSmart have to be mentioned as you'll most likely come across them when you're searching for these tent style enclosures. I got myself one of those \"generic\" ones which was branded by Sunlu and one from SainSmart which I'll show in the following and mention some pros and cons I personally consider worth mentioning. I didn't get the one fromm Creality as it was the narrowest among those offers (width ~47.5cm) - even though it would be sufficient and the printer would fit in there (without the spool holder being mounted to the side), I personally like a bit of additional space as I often get my hands on the hardware anyway and therefore won't need to always take the printer out of the enclosure when choosing a slightly wider tent.  </p> <p>Spool Holder</p> <p>With the regular sized tents like the ones being shown in the following, you can't use the stock spool holder being mounted to the left side of the frame. However, there's enough space to either put the spool on a custom spool holder you printed and placed next to the printer or you can also mount the spool to the top of the frame. The latter isn't really adviseable though, especially if you want to print with high speeds, as the additional and changing weight at the top does have an altering influence on the vibrations.</p> <p>Sunlu (imho \"generic\" type of tent) The size of this generic tent style enclosure one is about 55x64x74cm. Due to it's height, the enclosure allows the usage of a filament spool holder mounted to the top of the frame.    </p> Sunlu closed Sunlu open <p>When looking at the generic tent which in my case was branded by Sunlu, it hits the eye right away how thin the material actually is. The 'aluminum' is applied as some sort of sprayed on layer, there is no insulation between the outer material and the aluminum foil at the inside as there's just one layer of material.  If you place a lamp inside the enclosure, you can see the light shining through the material (in the picture of the closed tent above you can see some bright spots within the black material at the outside - this is the aluminum coating shining through the outer material!) - I think this already speaks for itself. As expected, the insulating effect on noise, temperatures and fumes therefore is only small. The zipper isn't covered in any way and it doesn't appear to be made of a high quality anyway. The rods are made from fibreglas, the parts where the rods are being stuck into are made from plastic. The following pictures show some close-up views of the material and the zipper.  </p> Zipper Material <p>You can open that front door completely all across the top. There's an additional opening at the left side which allows accessing the machine or feeding filament from outside - keep in mind though that this will lead to the fact that the heat won't be trapped inside anymore and airstreams could hit the bedplate. On the right side some pocketss for storing smaller parts are applied.  The following picture shows the left side of the enclosure with the part which can be opened.   </p> <p></p> <p>I personally used this enclosure for one of my Kobra Neos which I use for only printing PLA. When printing, I completely opened it. When not printing, this enclosure acted as a protection against dust and hairs of my cats. However, due to the fact that the following enclosure from SainSmart is just so much better, I ended up getting more of those and stowed away this thin generic one in my closet.</p> <p>If you're planning on using this type of tent in a really dusty environment though, like in a workshop where you also work with wood or so, I'd strongly recommend to get yourself the tent from SainSmart (see below) instead as the zipper and the whole material is made of a much better quality.   </p> <p>UPDATE: I gave this one away to a friend and got myself some more of the SainSmart enclosures when they were on sale. The quality is just outstanding compared to the 'generic' one I showed. </p> <p>SainSmart \"Upgraded Large Volume 3D Printer Enclosure\"  The size of this tent style enclosure from SainSmart one is about 54x62x72cm. Due to it's height, the enclosure allows the usage of a filament spool holder mounted to the top of the frame.  </p> SainSmart closed SainSmart open <p>When looking at the tent, you can tell the much better quality right away. The material itself isn't only thicker and more dense, it also consists different layers. There is the outer material, then you have some sort of foam insulation and an aluminum foil covering the inside. This results in a much better reduction of the noise and fumes and traps the heat inside the enclosure better as well. The risk of a fire hazard should be reduced much more significantly than at the generic tent, as we have a 'real' aluminum layer here instead of just some sort of sprayed-on aluminum-looking substance.  The zippers seem to be made of a better quality as well and they're somewhat covered. The rods of the frame are made from metal, the pieces where the rods get stuck in are plastic as well though.  The following pictures show some close-up views of the zipper and the material where you can clearly see the foam padding.   </p> Zipper Material <p>The front door can be opened all across the top as well and there is an additional opening at the top which can be used while the tent is closed. On the left side some pocekts for storing smaller parts are applied as well as some belts for e.g. hanging up filament spools. On the right side there's an additional oopening as well which allows you to access the machine from the side.  </p> Left side Top side Right side <p>Due to the better quality, I personally used this tent for one of my Kobra Neos which only prints other types of filament than PLA in the first place. But because the quality is just so much better than the quality of the generic one mentioned above, I ended up getting more of these enclosure from SainSmart and only use these ones now. Compared to the generic one, it's really impressive how much quieter the printer is and how much better the fumes are being kept iniside.  </p> <p>UPDATE: I gave the 'generic' one away to a friend and got myself some more of the SainSmart enclosures when they were on sale. The quality is just outstanding compared to the 'generic' one I showed. I even got myself more than I actually needed - just in case I'll get another machine. My cat loves them as well - she immediately seized the packages when I was setting up a new one..  </p> <p> </p> <p>Final thoughts on tent style enclosures My bottom line here about these two types of tent style enclosures would be: if you plan to use the enclosure for printing more demanding types of filament like ABS for example and not just like using it as a better dust protection cover, then I highly recommend getting the one from SainSmart. The difference in quality compared to the \"generic\" one from Sunlu shown above is like day and night and it's really impressive how much quieter the printer is and how much better the fumes are being kept inside with the enclosure from SainSmart compared to the generic one.   The enclosure from SainSmart usually is a bit more expensive that the cheapest generic ones you could get, but the much better quality is worth every buck. Sure, the generic one also works, and I used it for printing PETG as well (where using an enclosure isn't necessary, but it helps avoiding any cold airstream hitting the bed) as it was the first tent I got myself. When I then got the one from SainSmart and the difference in quality became obvious, I kind of did regret spending the money on the generic one though as it was only 20\u20ac less than the one from SainSmart.  </p> <p>However, due to the fact that the stock spool holder is mounted to the left side and the whole printer setup therefore gets wider, it most likely won't fit in these tent style enclosures anymore without using a different solution for the spool holder (I didn't check that yet as I'm not using the stock spool holder). It might be that the generic tents could be used when the lid on the left side is opened and the spool sticks out of the enclosure. As the one from SainSmart has the opening on the right side, this wouldn't be possible with that one then. Doing so might be counterproductive though, as the enclosure won't be closed anymore and a cold airstream might hit the bed. This wouldn't be a problem if you're only PLA anyway, but it would become a problem when printing more demanding types of filament which are sensitive to this. There are bigger tents available on the market es well, but of course that would come with the need of decent space to put them. So I personally would suggest to use a solution where the spool is held by a different type of spool holder, like using one of those abovementioned 4l cereal containers where you added a mechanism to feed the filament from. This also has the advantage that the humidity inside of the container can be held down (by adding a bag of silica gel) which serves those types of filament which tend to take up moisture faster than PLA (like PETG and TPU).  </p> <p> </p>"},{"location":"hardware/powersupply/","title":"Power Supply Unit","text":""},{"location":"hardware/powersupply/#power-supply-unit","title":"Power Supply Unit","text":"Specifications Input Voltage: 115V and 230V AC (choose the correct voltage by setting a switch before turning on the printer!)

Even though the MOSFET on the mainboard is sufficient, it's an upgrade worth doing as it not only leads to the fact that the bed will be heated up slightly faster, but it also increases the security of the hole printer. The MOSFET of the mainboard doesn't have a heatsink and it may caused by overheating due to an excessive amount of current being drawn, especially when using higher bed temperatures. Due to the low clearance between the fan of the moainboard and the ground the printer stands on, the cooling isn't the best as well. When using an enclosure which then heats up as well, cooling gets even worse. If the board's MOSTFET dies, you most likely have to get a whole new mainboard then. Even though it's possible to solder a new one onto the board (if you're skilled to do that), additional components might have been harmed. To avoid that, it's therefore adviseable to add an external MOSFET which then takes the load - the one on the mainboard only acts as a signal for the external one to switch.  </p> <p>The 24V DC of the PSU will be connected to the belonging connector of the external MOSFET.

I'd recommend to take a picture of each step, so that you can look at them later when reassembling - just in case you don't know how to proceed at a certain point or if you're not sure where certain screws belong.    </p> <p>Warning</p> <ul> <li>If you need to disassemble the printhead for e.g. changing the hotend, unload the filament first! </li> <li>For changing the nozzle or disassembling the heatbreak from the heater block, you have to heat up the parts first!  The main reason for that is to melt the filament which most likely entered little gaps there. Usually it's said that it should be around 200\u00b0C but that's probably not sufficient because (in my opinion) it depends on the material of the filament. So my suggestion is to heat up the extruder about 5-10\u00b0C more than the temperature you're printing with, then you should be on the safe side.  So either do that using the pre-heat function of the printer or by using a sufficient heat gut. However - don't burn yourself by touching the hot metal parts!</li> <li>Before starting to tinker turn off the printer and unplug it from the power outlet!</li> <li>Use the sufficient tools!  So please don't try to loosen the nozzle with a pair of pliers for example, use e.g. a wrench for that.  I also strongly recommend to not use a pair of pliers for the heater block, also for that you should use a wrench (if you don't have one of that size, use an adjustable one). A wrench has a smooth surface and therefore won't scratch the surface or even put dents into the block.  </li> <li>Make sure you don't lose a screw and make sure you'll know where the screws belong later when you want to reassemble everything again.  You might will be able to remember the belonging screws and positions if your tinkering lasts only an hour, but if anything crosses your plan and therefore you have to pause tinkering, you maybe won't remember one week later.

Then carefully push down that cap while paying attention that it really goes across the plug in the back as well.

If you still can't get your filament loaded, it's most likely that the PTFE tube inside of the hotend is clogged or deformed or that you have a clog in or above the nozzle somewhere. To clean, inspect and maintain it, you need to disassemble the hotend. Check the section \"Disassembling The Hotend\" further down below for more information.   </p> Retraction Settings <p>Make sure that you set the retraction distance and speed to the correct values for a direct drive in conjuction with a Volcano nozzle! In general, it's supposed to be something around 1mm retraction distance for direct drive systems, when using a Volcano nozzle you should be fine going up to 2mm. A bit more might work well also, but you don't want to risk pulling the hot and melted filament up in the cold zone of the heatbreak, so don't exxagerate increasing the retraction distance. Play around with the retraction speed as well, as the speed which is being used to actually retract the filament plays an important role as well. You can find some more information about this topic in the section \"Retraction Settings\".</p> Feeder Gear Pressure <p>When adjusting the pressure of the feeder gear, make sure you don't tighten it up too much as it could squeeze and deform the filament. On the other hand it shouldn't be too loose though as it should transport the filament reliably. The following picture shows you the location of the screw for adjusting the feeder gear tension. </p> <p>When pulling out the filament of the extruder system, you should notice little dents on the surface of the filament from the teeth of the feeder gear, the filament itself shouldn't be squeezed and deformed though, it should still be \"round\" so to say. You don't want the feeder gear to \"bite\" too much into the filament as well though, as this may lead to inconsistentites of the filament flow. I personally like to extrude a bit so that the gear actually has to pull it in. Then I do a cold pull and check the marks of the gear on the filament itself. If you can see and feel little marks of the teeth of the gear on the surface of the filament, then it should be ok. If you don't feel and see any marks, then it's too loose. PLA is pretty hard, so the pressure can/should be a bit higher as well, but if the marks are pretty deep, then it already might be too much. If the filament is already a bit squeezed and kinda flat, then it's definitely way too much pressure (you'll most likely experience some weird artefacts, inconcisties and patterns at your prints as well then).  The filament should be fed reliably, which especially comes into account while retracting. So keep an eye on the shaft of the motor by looking at the back of the motor - if you notice that it's slipping while retracting, you definitely need to increase the tension. As a rule of thumb you can keep in mind that the pressure should be higher when using hard filament like PLA and lower when using soft filament like TPU.  </p>"},{"location":"hardware/printhead/#disassembling-the-feeder-gear","title":"Disassembling The Feeder Gear","text":"<p>If problems with the feeder gear occur, you have to open the feeder gear box or even disassemble the whole system for cleaning, further inspections or replacing certain parts.

Check the section \"Disassembling The Hotend\" further down below for more information.     </p> Large Clump Of Melted Filament Built Up <p>Sometimes it may happen that melted filament builds up on top of the heater block to a large clump. The reason for that is that the heatbreak and the end of the nozzle don't touch tight enough, so that the melted filament can squeeze out. It also may be caused by bad and cheap parts where the threads aren't just as good as they should be.   So if you encouter this problem, here is what I recommend to do (based on my own experience with this dilemma).  </p> <ul> <li>Take off the plastic cover first to get better access to the whole area.  </li> <li>Heat up everthing.</li> <li>Once the filament starts to melt and became soft, I'd suppose to turn off the printer, just to make you don't cause any shortcuts in case you harm the wires.  </li> <li>Then grab a wooden stick and take away as much as possible carefully. Don't use a screwdriver or something like that to do so as you might harm the wires and/or cause a shortcut at e.g. the contacts of the cartridge heater. Be really careful when taking away the clumps to not harm or rip off any of the wires! You can also use a cloth to wipe off the melted filament from the heater block and so on, just make sure you don't burn yourself!  </li> <li>For the next steps you need to be a bit quick in proceeding them, so if this is the first time you're diassembling the hotend, take a look at the sections here at the page and read them first so you'll know where the screws are located and which steps you need to take. Then proceed with the following steps.</li> <li>So, once everything is as clean as possible, heat everything up again. The turn off the printer and loosen the two grub screws inside the heater block to take out the thermistor and the cartridge heater. Give it a quick wipe with the cloth if they're covered by a lot of filament, too (but don't waste too much time here as the filament is becoming hard again now pretty quick!). </li> <li>Then disassemble the hotend (see description below), so take out the nozzle from the heater block and unscrew the heater block from the heatbreal. Pay attention if you can feel that the heatbreak was loose in the heater block to check if that was the reason for the filament being able to squeeze out and build up. </li> <li>If you were using a cheap nozzle and have a spare one, just throw away the old one. If it's a good or your only nozzle, try to get it back to work again by giving it a proper cleaning and doing some cold pulls when it's installed again. </li> <li>Now put all the metal parts (heatbreak, heater block and probably the nozzle) in a glass with acetone. close the lid and let it sit there for about 24hrs.

Besides that, I personally think that friction might be added when using a reverse bowden. I also think that it might happen that there's different tension on the filament when the extruder moves around and when e.g. it's pushing back filament in certain positions, which imho might lead to differencies of the filament volume per extruder steps. This especially might come into place and cause issues when printing softer material like TPU.   I might be completely wrong with my assumptions though, so don't take my thoughts on this as being correct! Either just use the reverse bowden when changing the position of your spool or do some research about this topic on your own. I didn't really dive into this topic any further yet, but I most likely will do so anywhere in the future.   </p> <p>Reverse bowden tubes do have some advantages though, as they constrain the distance between their mounting point at the frame and the extruder.

Search for \"Kobra 2 hotend\" as those are the same being used.   </p> What Is A 100k NTC Thermistor? <p>A thermistor is an electronical part which changes resistances depending on the given temperature, the resistance will then be interpreted as a temperature reading. The thermistor being used is a 100k Ohm NTC type. That means, that it has a resistance of about 100k Ohm at 25\u00b0C temperature. When the temperature drops, the resistance will become higher/bigger. When the temperature rises, the resistance will become lower/smaller. As an example: at 20\u00b0C the resistance is about 125k Ohm; at 30\u00b0C the resistance is about 81k Ohm. Therefore you can measure the functionality of the thermistor by measuring the given resistance with a multimeter.

You'll risk a shortcut which then will harm your motherboard and might even cause more severe damage!  </p> <p>Generally speaking, you can check the wiring of the thermistor by measuring the electrical continuity of the wires. If your multimeter doesn't have this function, you can measure the resistance instead. However, it's advisable to measure the resistance, even though your multimeter offers the function of probing for continuity, because it might be the case that a wire still passes the check for continuity, but that individual strands of the wire are broken. This causes problems if those strands lose contact permanently or during movement of the head, as it leads to a higher resistance and therefore a wrong temperature being reported.  </p> <p>The difficulty here though is to actually measure one wire by itself, because you can only access one end of the wire (at the connector), the other end is inside of the thermistor's capsule. So if you measure the resistance probing at both contacts of the two wires, you already measure the thermistor itself as well.  However, by doing so you could still be able to tell if the wiring is faulty when you move the wires around while probing and see if the resistance value will spontaneously change. It actually wouldn't really help you in the end though to know if it's either the wiring or the thermistor itself, as you can't just change the wiring. Due to the construction of the thermistor and it's wiring, you'd have to replace the whole unit anyway though.  </p> Measuring / Checking The Thermistor <p>You can check if a thermistor is working or if it's somehow broken by measuring the resistance of it using a multimeter. As mentioned above, at a temperature of 25\u00b0C the resistance should be ~100k Ohm (nominal restistance: R25\u00b0C = 100 k\u03a9 \u00b1 1%). If the temperature is lower, the resistance value will be higher; if the temperature is higher, the resistance value will be lower. The following table gives you some typical resistance values of a 100K thermistor type 3950 (generic) for temperatures around room temperature.

If your multimeter doesn't have this function, you can measure the resistance instead.     However, it's advisable to measure the resistance, even though your multimeter offers the function of probing for continuity, because it might be the case that a wire still passes the check for continuity, but that individual strands of the wire are broken. This causes problems if those strands lose contact permanently or during movement of the head, as it leads to a higher resistance.

This also involves hardened steel nozzles! Referring to the manufacturers, the coating might be harmed when doing so.      </li> </ul> About Nozzles In General <ul> <li> <p>Do yourself a favour and don't buy those cheap brass nozzles where you'll get a dozen of them for a few bucks. It's just not worth it. Remember that the nozzle is pretty much the most crucial part when it comes down to printing and achieving good results, as it's the last link in the chain of the print process and puts out the filament - so go for an established manufacturer who is known for producing quality nozzles.   Means, avoid those cheap sets of nozzles where you get a dozen nozzles for a few bucks. Those often lack quality: the bore might be off-center and/or might have a burr (which leads to heavy stringing), the thread might not be precise (which leads to leaking) and so on.   I personally only use original E3D Volcano nozzles. Yes, they are a bit more expensive than the super cheap ones, but it's still a good price and it's really worth it - they last longer, they're precisely made and you'll get much better results. As long as you don't want to print special abrasive filaments, you're always good with the standard E3D V6 brass nozzles.  </p> </li> <li> <p>If you want to print filaments that are more abrasive, you probably want to go with nozzles made from plated copper, stainless or hardened steel, ruby sapphire nozzles and so on. Check out the web for further and more specific information about what to choose.   Be aware of the fact though, that the manufacturers clearly advise against doing cold pulls with any kind of coated nozzles! This also involves hardened steel nozzles! Referring to them, the coating might be harmed when doing so.  </p> </li> </ul> About Nozzle Sizes <p>When it comes down to choose the right nozzle size, it all depends on what you want to print and how detailed it should be. The standard size of 0.4mm the printers come with is a good starting point. However, you may find yourself in the situation that you want to print more detailed objects or objects which should be more sturdy or where it doesn't matter if the surface doesn't look as clean and flat as possible, so you probably should adjust the size and switch to a smaller oder bigger diameter like 0.2mm for high detailed objects and 0.6mm for the 'rougher' prints.  Keep in mind though that the printing time usually increases by choosing a smaller diameter and it decreases when you're using a bigger diameter. The printing time as well as the quality also depends on the layer height you're using, so by choosing a smaller layer height you can also get detailed and great looking prints with a 0.6mm nozzle. Last but not least a smaller nozzle bore is more likely to clog and some filaments even have a sticker on the spool saying that e.g. it should be printed with minimum a 0.4mm nozzle. So choose wisely if you really want to use a nozzle with a 0.2mm bore for example.  </p> <p>Search the web for more specific information about finding and choosing the right nozzle size for your project. You may want to start with this article from All3DP: The Best 3D Printer Nozzle Types, Sizes &amp; Materials.  </p> <p>In the following I'll mention some aspects you should be aware of when choosing a different nozzle size, particularly when choosing a bigger nozzle. Most people seem to be stuck to the common 0.4 nozzle and don't seem to be aware of the fact that one can still get 'fine' detailed outcomes (more or less - of course there's a difference in the ability of printing super fine details when e.g. comparing a 0.2 to a 0.6 nozzle..) or 'even' surfaces with a bigger nozzle size as well if e.g. going with the same layer height. The increased line width helps cutting down the printing time and makes prints even more rigid.   </p> <p>For testing around just copy your existent profile and change the nozzle size in there. Save it as an own profile and start playing around. </p> <ul> <li>Printing temperature: when using a bigger nozzle, one needs to keep an eye on the printing temperature. The bigger the nozzle is, the more filament will flow thru the bore at the same time - and therefore less time it has to completely melt so to say. So instead of using the same temp like with the 0.4 nozzle, increase the temperature. How much that has to be depends on the diameter of the nozzle, the type of filament etc - so maybe start with increasing 5\u00b0C or 10\u00b0C and see how it turns out.  </li> <li>Printing speed: the same as for the printing temp. Generally speaking, the faster you want to print, the hotter you have to print as well to compensate/reach the higher flowrate and have the same amount melted in the same time. I often see ppl going with e.g. 190-200\u00b0 for PLA and trying to print at the max speeds the new K2 models can reach - that most likely doesn't work. Instead, increase the temp and/or decrease the speed.  </li> </ul> <p>For both of these points there are somewhat limitations tho, so when e.g. printing small and thin parts you'll most likely run into issues when printing too fast as well as when printing too hot, as the material might not have enough time to cool down properly and therefore curls up or behaves weird in other ways. One can try to compensate that (besides choosing the suitable speed&amp;temp) by making use of the minimum layer time settings in the slicer.  </p> <ul> <li>Retraction settings: you need to keep an eye on and dial in your retraction settings when using a bigger nozzle size. Try different retraction speed settings as well, not only retraction distance.  </li> <li>Use the Arachne feature in your Slicer - Prusa has it and iirc also Cura has it.   That being said, when using a bigger nozzle, you might want to check if it makes sense to add one or two more walls. As most of the models are somewhat designed for being printed with the common 0.4 nozzle, I found that this comes into account when choosing the amount of walls and the percentage of the infill as well. So adding e.g. one more wall can often save you from printing any infill and you'll end up with a cleaner and even more rigid print.  </li> <li>You can also take advantage of the feature \"adaptive layer height\". However, when doing so, keep an eye on the settings as you might reach the maximum flowrate (= limit) or even try to go beyond it. There are online calculators you can use where you type in the layer height, line width and printing speed and then you'll have the according flowrate calculated.  </li> <li>There's a 'physical' limitation to what's possible in terms of maximum flowrate and even the thermal conductivity of the filament itself. So don't expect to successfully use a 1mm nozzle at 300mm/s printing speed  printing huge models with super long layer lines from regular PLA - that most likely won't work out. There are a few things one could do when trying to really reach or even go beyond the limits, like using a Volcano CHT nozzle, using specific HighSpeed-filament and so on.  </li> <li>I personally use plated copper heater blocks at my printers, even tho I'm not going for the highest possible speed. Imho it made a difference due to the increased thermal mass of the heavy copper block vs the aluminum block.   </li> <li>Depending on what speeds should be reached and how big the nozzle will be in the end, it might be good/useful to also use a more powerful heater cartridge when already changing the heater block to a plated copper one. This shouldn't be necessary for the typical user tho as the stock one is 60W and that's usually plenty enough, but just in case one really wants to push the limits, it might be good to have an extra 10W or so and use a 70W heater instead.  </li> </ul>"},{"location":"hardware/printhead/#spare-nozzles","title":"Spare Nozzles","text":"<p>If you need to replace the nozzle, you either have to buy spare part nozzles directly from Anycubic or find a 3rd party seller who sells these specific nozzles.

Referring to the manufacturers, the coating might be harmed when doing so.  </p> Cleaning The Nozzle <ul> <li>For cleaning the nozzle and getting rid of excessive filament during the printing process or right before printing starts as the extruder is heating up, you can use a long and thin wooden stick like a skewer. A wooden toothpick also works fine - just make sure you don't burn yourself as it may be a bit short. I personally use these long pipe cleaners which have this kinda cotton stuff all around them. It doesn't melt when touching the hot nozzle and filament sticks great to it.  </li> <li>Before and after each print I recommend to wipe away the melted filament at the nozzle with a 'cotton' pipe cleaner, a paper towel or a cloth - but don't burn yourself! This procedure keeps the nozzle clean and the rest of the filament won't burn black onto the brass which makes it hard to remove later.   </li> <li>If the nozzle is already too smeared and has too much filament burnt onto the surface to be cleaned with a paper towel, you can use a small brass brush. Be careful though to not harm the tip of the nozzle by scrubbing too hard across it! Be careful to not touch any wires or contacts during brushing at it may cause a shortcut and blow off your mainboard! So I'd suggest you heat up the nozzle and then turn off the printer before starting to brush.  </li> <li>If the nozzle is clogged, using a needle with the correct diameter to stick it into the hot nozzle for cleaning it sometimes works. Just stick in in the heatened up nozzle and poke around. Be careful to not harm the tip of the nozzle though!  </li> <li>You can also use certain filament which is made for cleaning. You load it and let it run through. </li> <li>If the nozzle is clogged and therefore the cleaning filament can't run through, you could also try to do a \"cold pull\". To do so you heat up the nozzle to about 220\u00b0C, load the cleaning filament and manually push it through a bit. Then let the nozzle cool down to about 90-100\u00b0C and rip out the filament. You may have to repeat this procedure a few times until the cleaning filament can run through again. However, be careful not to rip off the filament by doing the cold pull as you then definitely have to disassemble the hotend. Attention: don't do cold pulls when using any kind of coated nozzles! This also involves hardened steel nozzles! The manufacturers say that it might harm the coating of the inside of the nozzle! </li> <li>If you still encounter problems with the flow of the filament though or if you even can't load new filament, most likely the little PTFE tube inside of the heatbreak is clogged. Scroll down to the \"Disassembling\" section where you'll find a little guide about how to get it out and clean it.  </li> <li>If you took out the nozzle from the heater block and can't get it clean, heat it up with a hot air gun. Then you can poke out the soft filament. You can also try to put it in acetone and let it sit there - the longer the better (I'd say minimum 24hrs). This method works especially great with ABS as that just dissolves, but it also works at least a bit with other types of filament like PLA (although not as good as with ABS at all) and makes it a bit softer. Then you can try to poke the filament out. This also works with the heater block and the heatbreak if you want to clean them also.

Due to the sudden decrease of temperature the metal of the nozzle will contract a tiny bit which may result in being able to unscrew it.  </li> <li>For installing the new nozzle, screw it in and turn it back about one rotation once you feel it hits the heatbreak. I personally do this after everything cooled down until it's safe to touch because then I can screw in the nozzle by hand and therefore I can feel right at the start if it doesn't sit correctly.</li> <li>Check if you didn't harm any wires! </li> <li>If everything is fine, power up the printer and heat up the extruder again. Most nozzle manufacturers say that you should heat it up to about 250\u00b0C, but that might already harm the PTFE tube. So go with 230-240\u00b0.  </li> <li>Then carefully tighten up the nozzle, but don't overtighten it though. However, you need to make sure that it's tight enough (about 1.5NM) and that it really touches the heatbreak! There shouldn't be any gap between the heatbreak and the nozzle inside of the heater block!  </li> <li>Don't get irritated by the fact that there's a little gap between the head of the nozzle and the heater block oncce you installed everything correctly - that's totally fine and it's supposed to be like that as the following picture shows.  </li> </ul>"},{"location":"hardware/printhead/#part-cooling-fan","title":"Part Cooling Fan","text":"<p>The part cooling fan is a 24V, 0.14A, 50x50x20mm blower, model \"Coolcox BF5020H24D\".  </p> <p>According to the specifications of the manufacturer, the bearing type of this fan is a 2-ball bearing.

I'll mostly list parts which aren't that expensive and pretty much known to fail sooner or later. Some of them count as consumables (like nozzles or v-slot wheels for example) and I highly recommend to have at least one or two items of them on stock, others are parts which are nice to have to be on the safe side if anything breaks.    </p> <p>However, it does make sense to check whether it's cheaper to get certain parts on their own or to buy a complete spare part. As an example I'd mention the parts of the printhead here. If you'll get the fans, the thermistor, cartridge heater, heater block, hotend etc. as individual parts it most likely makes more sense to get yourself a complete new printhead as a spare part right away. Of course you still should get nozzles and silicone socks anyway, but if you'd have to pay pretty much the same or even more for some individual parts as for a complete printhead, why should you buy individual parts then? Remember that the whole printhead also includes the distribution PCB, the feeder gear, the plastic cover, the metal plate, the stepper motor and so on.  </p> <p>Anyway - even though it most likely makes more sense to buy a complete printhead to have all the parts stocked, I'll list the imho most important parts from that device also individually.  </p> <p>Consumables which you'll definitely need (sooner or later):  </p> <ul> <li>Nozzle</li> <li>PTFE tube / bowden tube plus couplings (Capricorn XS recommended)</li> <li>Silicone sock</li> <li>V-slot wheels, SG15 bearings</li> <li>Anti-backlash nut</li> </ul> <p>Good to have because they will most likely fail when you really need the printer to work:  </p> <ul> <li>Thermistor</li> <li>Cartridge heater</li> <li>Heater block </li> <li>Heatbreak </li> <li>Hotend</li> <li>Belts</li> <li>Heatsink fan / hotend fan</li> <li>Part cooler fan</li> <li>Part cooler fan duct </li> </ul> <p>Of course you can also stock motors, a lead screw, a mainboard, a power supply unit, a control unit and so on, but in case something like that breaks you might also have other, more severe problems. Due to the fact that those parts aren't the cheapest ones to get, you probably want to get them at the time you need them.      </p>"},{"location":"hardware/spare_parts/#where-to-get","title":"Where To Get","text":"<p>When you need to change certain parts or you need to fix them, check out the Anycubic site and watch out for the correct printer model. Anycubic doesn't seem to offer many parts though, especially not for this particular machine at the time of writing this, so you might want to look through Anycubic's store at AliExpress as well.  </p> <p>There are also vendors who sell compatible or even original spare parts, so just do a bit of a research. If you're located in Europe, I can recommend looking at the shop of 3D Jake.  </p> <p>Also many parts from third party manufacturers can be used as many of the parts are common components of these kinds of machines.   So if you're looking for parts like v-slot wheels, belts, anti-backlash nuts or even a new lead screw or motor for example, keep in mind that those aren't 'specific' parts most of the time - they're pretty much regular components.   </p> <p>Have a look at the spare part you need and do a little research if it really is something 'special' that pretty much only Anycubic or authorized sellers are offering (like the mainboard), or if that's a 'regular' component and therefore could be found easily.  </p> <p> </p>"}]}
