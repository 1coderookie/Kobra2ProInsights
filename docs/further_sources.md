# Further Sources Of Information
In the following you'll find some further sources for certain kind of information mentioned.

## Anycubic 
Here of course the [Anycubic website](https://www.anycubic.com) has to be mentioned first.  
You can find [manuals and firmware](https://www.anycubic.com/pages/firmware-software) at their support page.  
They also produced some video tutorials about e.g. changing the printhead or the mainboard for the **Go** and the **Neo**. You can find them at their [guide videos page](https://www.anycubic.com/pages/guide-videos).  
Pretty much all of these information are also available at their [blog page](https://www.anycubic.com/blogs/news/all-you-need-to-know-about-kobra-series).

## General Information
There are many great websites and YouTube channels out there and if you're already into this whole 3D printing thing, you probably already have your favourites. So it's hard for me to recommend any.  
However, if you're new to this whole thing (or if you've never heard of one of the following), I'd recommend taking a look at the following sources:  

- [Website of All3DP](https://all3dp.com/)
- [Website of Thomas Sanladerer aka "Tom's 3D"](https://toms3d.org/) and [his YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/thomassanladerer)

In the following I'll list some of the pages where you can search and find free 3D models. I only list those pages where you don't need a registration and where you can get free 3D models.  
Some of the following pages offer direct downloads (DD), others are search engines (SE).

## G-Code Documentation
If you're new to this whole 3D printing world, then you might want to start reading the article from [All3DP: 3D Printer G-code Commands: Main List & Quick Tutorial](https://all3dp.com/2/3d-printer-g-code-commands-list-tutorial/) to get an overview about what G-code is.  
  
For a complete reference of G-codes, you might want to have a look at the following 'official' sources.  
Of course there are countless sites to find which cover this topic, but the following ones are definitely the one I'd look up first.    

---

### RepRap
The first one to mention is the [RepRap Wiki](https://reprap.org/wiki/G-code), where you can find a general explanation about what G-code is, how it works and all the [G-commands](https://reprap.org/wiki/G-code#G-commands).  
*Within the G-commands section and the specific commands you'll also see tables which firmware (Marlin/Klipper/RepRap/Repetier/Smoothie) supports the specific command.* 

---
   
### Marlin 
The stock firmware is based on Marlin v2.0.x. You can find a complete G-code command reference at the belonging [Marlin website](https://marlinfw.org/meta/gcode/).  

---
  
### Klipper 
Besides most of the standard G-code Klipper does support (Attention: it doesn't support *all* of the standard commands!), Klipper uses so called "extended" G-code commands and scripts/macros for general status and configuration. These extended commands start with a command which may be followed by one or more parameters. You can find the whole reference at the [Klipper documentation page about G-codes](https://www.klipper3d.org/G-Codes.html).
