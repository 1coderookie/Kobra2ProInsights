# Printer
The Anycubic [**Kobra 2 Pro**](https://www.anycubic.com/products/kobra-2-pro) is a high speed FDM bedslinger style printer.  
It comes pre-assembled, you only have to mount a few parts like the 'upstanding' frame onto the base frame.  

See [Anycubic's support page](https://www.anycubic.com/pages/firmware-software) of the Kobra 2 series to find manuals, firmware, video tutorials and more or use the direct links in the following.
