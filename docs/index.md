# Welcome  
to my infopage about Anycubic's **Kobra Go** and **Kobra Neo**.   
  
Here you'll find specific information about both models as well as more general kind of information.  
I created this page to make it easier for users of these printers to get started, as well as to provide specific information on e.g. how to maintain the printers.  
  
Please make sure to **mind the (expandable) textboxes** as they contain valuable information!  
Depending on the color of the box, it's either a tip, information, instruction, question or warning you'll find in there:    

??? tip "Tip"  

    Like "Level the position of the ABL sensor in relation to the nozzle."

??? info "Information" 

    Like "Information about nozzles in general." 

??? example "Instruction"

    Like "How to disassemble the hotend."

??? question "Question"

    Like "Have a **Go** and wanna contribute?"

!!! warning "Warning"

    Textboxes which contain a warning will be displayed extended already to make sure the warning won't be overseen.
    
!!! danger "Danger"

    Textboxes which contain a warning about a dangerous circumstance will be displayed extended already to make sure the warning won't be overseen.

 
**Please take your time and read attentively.**    
  
***Happy tinkering and printing!***
