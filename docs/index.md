# Welcome  
to my infopage about Anycubic's **Kobra 2 Pro**.   
  
Here you'll find specific information about this specific Kobra 2 model as well as more general kind of information.  
I created this page to make it easier for users of this printers to get started, as well as to provide specific information on e.g. how to maintain the printer.    

***ATTENTION:***  
***THIS SITE IS CURRENTLY WIP, THERE'S NO REAL CONTENT IN HERE YET!***   
 
**Fyi: I recently won a Kobra 2 Pro and I'm already preparing this infosite, I didn't even receive the printer yet though, so don't bother reading around as you won't find any information about the Kobra 2 Pro yet anyway. So please bare with me and come back another time.. ;)**
  
Please make sure to **mind the (expandable) textboxes** as they contain valuable information!  
Depending on the color of the box, it's either a tip, information, instruction, question or warning you'll find in there:    

??? tip "Tip"  

    Like "Level the position of the ABL sensor in relation to the nozzle."

??? info "Information" 

    Like "Information about nozzles in general." 

??? example "Instruction"

    Like "How to disassemble the hotend."

??? question "Question"

    Like "Have a **Kobra 2 Pro** and wanna contribute?"

!!! warning "Warning"

    Textboxes which contain a warning will be displayed extended already to make sure the warning won't be overseen.
    
!!! danger "Danger"

    Textboxes which contain a warning about a dangerous circumstance will be displayed extended already to make sure the warning won't be overseen.

 
**Please take your time and read attentively.**    
  
***Happy tinkering and printing!***
