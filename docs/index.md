# Welcome  
to my infosite about Anycubic's **Kobra 2 Pro**.   
  
Here you'll find specific information about this specific printer model as well as more general kind of information.  
I created this site to make it easier for users of this printer to get started, as well as to provide specific information on e.g. how to maintain the printer.

A few tips for browsing this site:    
Please make sure to **mind the (expandable) textboxes** as they contain valuable information!  
Depending on the color of the box, it's either a tip, information, instruction, question or warning you'll find in there:    

??? tip "Tip"  

    Like "Level the position of the ABL sensor in relation to the nozzle."

??? info "Information" 

    Like "Information about nozzles in general." 

??? example "Instruction"

    Like "How to disassemble the hotend."

??? question "Question"

    Like "Have a **Kobra 2 Pro** and wanna contribute?"

??? warning "Warning"

    Textboxes which contain a warning will often be displayed being already extended to make sure the warning won't be overseen.
    
??? danger "Danger"

    Textboxes which contain a warning about a dangerous circumstance will often be displayed being already extended to make sure the warning won't be overseen.

Please mind the **search field** in the header as well as the icon in the header for toggling between the bright and the dark mode of this site.

Last but not least:  
**Please take your time and read attentively.**    
  
***Happy tinkering and printing!***
