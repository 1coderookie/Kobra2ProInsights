# Introduction
Anycubic decided to choose the closed source path with the new Kobra 2 models now (Kobra 2 Neo, Pro, Plus & Max).  
Means, especially for the models Kobra 2 Pro, Plus & Max, there isn't even a possibility to connect to the machine locally as these machines don't offer an e.g. USB-C port for doing so and the WiFi only connects to their own servers.  

However, Anycubic decided to develop their 'own' firmware, called "KobraOS".  
This one is actually based on Klipper, which (imho!) therefore *should* be released as being open source due to Klipper's license.  
However, it seems that no action has been taken yet at the time of writing this to go against this behaviour of Anycubic.  

Once there were successful attempts of installing [Klipper](fw_klipper.md), you can find the information I then hopefully came across in the specific section.
