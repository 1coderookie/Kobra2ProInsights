# Introduction
At the time of writing this (September 2023), nothing is really known about the stock firmware "Kobra OS" as it seems that Anycubic decided to make this system closed source. Hopefully this will change in the future..  

However, it *seems* that it's somewhat Klipper-based, as the setting for the g-code flavour in the PrusaSlicer profile offered from Anycubic for this machine is set to Klipper.  

Once there is anything to share, you'll find further information about the [stock firmware](fw_kobraOS.md) of the **Kobra 2 Pro** here in the belonging section then - like how to install updates, information about specific settings and known restrictions.  

Once there were successful attempts of installing [Klipper](fw_klipper.md), you can find the information I then hopefully came across in the specific section.  

*If you have any further information, either about the stock firmware or about attempts of flashing Klipper, please reach out via email (see footer)!*
