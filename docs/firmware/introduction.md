# Introduction
Anycubic decided to choose the closed source path with the Kobra 2 Pro/Plus/Max models now.  
Means, there isn't even a possibility to connect to the machine locally as these machines don't offer an e.g. USB-C port for doing so and the WiFi only connects to their own servers.  

However, Anycubic decided to develop their 'own' firmware, called "KobraOS".  
This one is actually somewhat-based on Klipper, which (imho!) therefore *should* be released as being open source due to Klipper's license.  
However, it seems that no action has been taken yet at the time of writing this to go against this behaviour of Anycubic.  

Investigations are currently being made by members of the community and there already have been successful approaches to hack the closed stock firmware. One can now already decrypt certain logs, get root access or even change settings by using specific commands.  
However, I won't go deeper into this right now and just link to the corresponding thread in the Klipper discourse group instead, so you can read around yourself: [Klipper Discourse Group: Printer.cfg for Anycubic Kobra 2 Plus/Pro/Max](https://klipper.discourse.group/t/printer-cfg-for-anycubic-kobra-2-plus-pro-max/11658)  

Once there were successful attempts of installing Klipper, you can find the necessary information (which I'll then hopefully come across) in the specific [Klipper chapter](fw_klipper.md).
