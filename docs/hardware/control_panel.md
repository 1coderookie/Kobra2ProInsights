# Control Panel  
The printer comes with a 4.3" touch display.  
It's mounted to the front right edge of the baseframe.  
There's no additional microSD card slot located at this panel.

At the backside of the control unit is a connector where the flat ribbon cable must be plugged in accordingly.

The control panel allows you to control the printer manually.    
You can e.g. initiate the bed leveling process, heat up the extruder, load and unload filament, adjust your z-offset, home one or all axes, chosse the file you want to print and so on.  
The usage is pretty easy and self-explaining, so at this point I won't add pictures of the menu or so.  
See your manual for further information of the possible actions you can take.  
  
It also displays status information like the current temperatures and the temperatures that should be reached due to a certain function or during the printing process as well as error messages if they occur. 
  
The display also displays error messages if any severe errors occur. See the section ["Error Messages"](../problems.md#error-messages) for further information.
